         "I have recently looked into reddit and found that this place is actually quite healthy and supportive... I did not know this place really existed... but anyways I have very little motivation to work my way up the employment ladder whether its for a career or min wage job... as I feel so very few careers are really interested in helping people. I am an out of the box thinker and I know most jobs will slice my head if I try quacking about maybe we can serve people first and then profit second...I do not think I have much to say, but I look very young for 26 and it seems that is a turn off for most girls. I initially tried being a psych communications major in college but dropped out as someone in a way handed me a red pill. Since about 6 years ago since that happened, I have been studying different sources on the internet to help me perform at my best if there ever was an opportunity that did not require a degree. But I have little faith and try to make creations and upload maybe assist others in some meaningful way and also make a return. ANYWAYYYSSSSSS I know my story does not sound so bad and I think a big chunk of life is how we perceive things versus how they actually are. I do not have a motivation to get a car or a job because my god mother pays for the rent and allows me free time to make creations, but I do not have a circle of friends that is interested in what I have to share. So I am wondering how I can make money with my stuff without paying for ads or self-promoting. I have asked myself how can I honestly make connections if I do not promote? Some people say offer your work for free and I do offer some stuff for free, but it is quite impersonal type of work and people these days are looking to eat up as much emotion as they can in order to fuel a like or a subscribe reaction. For some reason, I try to stay as impersonal as possible with all my work and it seems to kind of work against me in this type of culture. I am not very attached to specific beliefs or ideas.... so it seems like that is a free ticket for capitalism to rape me.... if this is my destiny.... then what can I do? I have thought about dying voluntarily from malnutrition going out into a rural area and just letting go from there.... but that would be a tough way to go it seems but that could also be a perception. I am not very suicidal to be honest but it comes up. But anyways, I do not really ever share this stuff and I am sorry if it sounds like I am messed up. I am not going to get help if you think I need it. I consider myself kind of an anti-capitalist/materialist but do like small talk and jokes... if anyone of any gender would like to talk and maybe become friends or just talk for a short while without small talk, you would not be ghosted. End: I really do not like how our problems in society are so obvious and yet people play fucking dumb when realizing when someone is having issues... they must be really fucking hurting if they are playing that low... there must be another level of empathy above where I am at if I cannot see that these people are actually hurting inside, but they do a good damn job of putting a smile on their face and saying another day another dollar.

         "Is it good to only focus on 1 goal? What I mean is, for example I have these goals:\n\n1. Find a good job OR start and grow a succesful company\n2. Find the one who will marry me in the future\n3. Find out which religion is the true one / read the whole bible\n\nSo my idea is, I will only work towards one goal at the same time. If I choose goal 1 and I choose to study or gain work experience, then I will not read the bible and I will not be on dating apps, because I should not overwhelm myself and risk a burn-out. If I choose goal 2, I will be very busy with dating apps and alternatives, but I will not have a job and I will not be studying. If I choose 3, I will read the bible a few hours every day, but I will not do any other productive things.\n\nWhat is the good side of this by my own thought?\n\n1. Whichever goal is the most important one, OR has to be completed the fastest, can get priority and full focus :)\n2. By only having one thing to work on, you have less risk of ending up with 0 free time, so you can avoid burn-out and instead, work at your own pace. (careful: do not get lazy)\n\nWhat is the bad side of this by my own thought?\n\n1. Spending hours everyday on the same goal only, can become boring. Some goals also do not require many hours every day: for example going to the gym. Being in the gym for 5 hours is a terrible idea, so if you have goals that require less time per day, you can actually pick 2 or 3 of these goals to fill your day.\n2. Some goals must be worked on at the same time. For example, you should not avoid studying because you're too busy with going to gym. But while you study, going to the gym is still important for your health. So I would call this an exception to this \"1 goal only\" idea.\n\nThese days it seems socially acceptable that people do 3 things at the same time: study, have a job, have a social life. Where's the free time to relax? Right it doesnt exist, and even worse, sometimes all these activities take up more than 24 hours a day, which results in someone being overwhelmed and getting behind on everything. Actually this is what I have experienced. Its not a theory, it is very real.\n\nI have a burn-out. I have been stressed 24/7 for a really long time, because I was focusing on too many things at once. I had to get my homework done, I had to spend all my free time on dating apps, I had to go to gym, etc, I had no free time left.\n\nSo my plan is to only work on one goal at once, and spend all free time as actual free time, to relax or enjoy it.\n\nQuestion : is this a good idea, or do you see any flaws with it?",

         "Last year, during the UK lockdown, was the very first time I have ever wanted to die. It got so extreme that I came off of the internet for a few days to try to heal. I did not know what caused it. I will probably never find out. But i did heal...slightly. After about 3 days I realised that I did not want to die and my suicidal thoughts were gone almost instantly but the depression was not. I have spent a year feeling nothing but numbness, guilt and anger. Nothing else. I have had to force a laugh for a year. At one point, I tried to reach out for help but because of covid, no one was there for me in school or in the community. And now I have slipped back into my depression it is numb, but it is emotionally draining. I have had to force myself to write (which is the only hobby I can peruse because my other ones are social hobbies) to which I just think 'what is the point?\". I cannot look at my body without feeling sick of the sight. it is hard to get out of bed but when I do, I just sit there and wait. there is nothing to do. Nothing to wait for. Getting in showers or baths has become so difficult that I have resorted to making a timetable of when I need to shower. I cannot be bothered pretending anymore. I am not okay.I cannot reach out for help. My parents will think I am faking it. My friends could not care in the slightest. I do not go back to school until August (which I am dreading). I do not have anyone to turn to. In all honesty, I could not name one person that I would be able to go to for help. I do not want to die but I do not see the point in living. This is a rant more than anything. This is not a sob story. I am sure quite a few people have gone through this same experience. I can just feel myself go downhill with every passing day. I have not felt raw joy since I do not know when. I cannot remember. The numbness is almost like an uncomfortable calmness and I cannot shake myself out of it. I am self destructing again",

         "I think I am depressed. I decided to type out and share some of my feelings and thoughts in order to get them off my chest and to hopefully receive some helpful advice or encouraging words from one of the people reading this.I was raised as a Christian and I was a believer until my early teenage years. Then, a relative of mine passed away, very suddenly, from cancer. She was still in her thirties. It made no sense to me. She was a very generous, sweet, hospitable, warm and loving woman. It made me question if there is a god and why he would allow something like this to happen to such a good person. The death of my relative turned me into a bit of a hedonist. My reasoning: Why would I do tedious things, if something like this can happen to anyone? What is the point in studying for a boring test when I could die tomorrow? I knew that the chances of me dying were slim, but there are never guarantees.Then, I identified as an agnostic atheist for a few years, before I finally became an atheist a few years ago. I am now at a point where I believe our existence is merely a coincidence. We are just descendants of monkeys on a tiny blue rock and the unfortunate tragedy is that we can reflect on our own existence. I am the kind of person who tries to make sense of everything. I usually try to be as unbiased as possible and to use facts in order to form my opinion. That is why it is so hard for me to come to terms with the fact that life is very unfair and random.By making smart choices (living healthily, working hard, etc.), you can only increase your chances of living a good life, but there are no guarantees. Our 1 and only life is a game of chance, which is a truth that is hard for me to fathom.The state of the world pisses me off too. Why the fuck is there still racism? Why are LGBTQIA+ people still being treated unfairly? Why are we allowing capitalism, overconsumption and greed to completely destroy our planet? Why are there billionaires? Why are millions of people starving, while others care about buying the latest clothes and gadgets? How am I supposed to care about school when these problems still exist? Perhaps I am just a sensitive little bitch, idk.Speaking of being a bitch, I fucking love my parents and I cannot stomach that someday, they will die. I start crying even just thinking about losing them at some point in the future. I genuinely believe they are some of the best human beings on the earth. I have thought about suicide but I do not think I would be able to do that to my parents, who are my everything. So the harsh reality is that either I will lose them, or they will lose me. So, if I do not want to commit suicide, it is inevitable that I will lose my parents at some point (if I manage to live that long) and that I will have to continue to live life on a planet full of greed and hate. A life that is inextricably linked to suffering. I have heard people say time and time again that life IS suffering, but even when that is seen as a universal truth, that does not mean that it becomes easier to accept that truth. That truth does not suddenly become easier to bear.I have briefly read about Camus (and the myth of Sisyphus) and while I agree with his worldviews and the absurdity of life, I cannot really see myself following the example of Sisyphus. I cannot see how I could accept having to roll the boulder up the hill for the rest of my life.For a few years, the idea of building a legacy intrigued me. What if I could make art or start institutions that could stand the test of time. My name would be cemented in history. Then, I had a shocking realisation. When I die, I will not be there to enjoy the legacy I built. I do not know what to do. I still enjoy sports, hedonism and other forms of escapism, but only because they allow me a temporary escape from life's inherent suffering. Perhaps I am a 'pussy' or a 'coward' but I honestly cannot take it anymore. This existence is overwhelming. Fed up with this unfair and cruel world and life's inherent suffering",

I feel like everything is pointing towards us breaking up.we have been dating for about 1.5 years. I have GAD and moderate/mild depression. I am currently on medications and in therapy. He has severe depression (and anxiety I suspect), and has been in therapy before. Hes going back to therapy, but there were not any availabilities until August. He has a history of getting depressed in relationships (previous two gfs and me).He and I have similar histories. Both our families had pretty nasty divorces. Both of our mothers developed cancer while we were still young teenagers. Our families are in similar geographic regions. We both had a relationship that was emotionally abusive. I guess I mention these because it was easy for us to understand each other when we first met, but also because I think these could have impacted our mental developments and relationships.Both my partner and I are in graduate school. He has a major exam coming up that determines if he will qualify for candidacy. This exam has been looming for a while and has been pushed back a couple of times because of COVID, but also because he was not prioritizing preparing for it. This stressor is contributing to his depression.The other stressor is our relationship. Its been on the rocks for a couple of months now. He left to visit family in May and he was not in the mood to have sex when he came back. I miss the sexual intimacy, but I am much prefer physical affection and emotional intimacy. Having said that, its always been hard for him to open up to me. In June, he did something that really upset me at the time, which started his spiraling. I have since forgiven him, but I do not think hes forgiven himself. He admitted hes been depressed for a while now. I did not see the signs very well and attributed it to stress from his exam (before I knew our relationship was also stressing him out). He said a lot of self-hate things and started punching himself in the face. I called his dad and told him what is going on because I felt like I could not be his only support. we have been in limbo (how he described it) since June. We did not see each other much the first couple of weeks because we both needed space. After that, I have been the one initiating contact and hanging out to get a feel for things. we have been telling we love and miss each other still. However, he told me this weekend that the physical affection is hurting him and he was not comfortable with me going to our mutual friends because he cannot be a boyfriend right now. For 4th of July, he also did not act like my boyfriend.This really hurt me but I have been trying to listen to his needs more because of his depression. Hes asked for more space to focus on school, which also hurts but I do the same when I need to get work done. I have tried to get him into our schools counseling between now and his regular therapist, but he does not want to talk to a new therapist. I have also tried to get him to couples therapy. He said he would go, but its obvious he does not want to be there, so I have not scheduled anything because I do not think it would be productive if he does not want to be there. I have asked if I can help him around his house because he is not taking care of himself. I have asked how can I support him, which was the space mentioned above.He does not know what he wants in regards to us. I do not know if its the depression talking. Hes scared if we have an on and off relationship that I will eventually leave him for good because an ex did that. Hes thinks I am disappointed in him (I have never said this, he sets these expectations for himself) because he cannot be a boyfriend right now. I feel he does love me because 1) friends and his family have told me he loves and cares about me very much, 2) he showed it through his actions before all of this, 3) he told me he loves making me happy. But, my doubts have been creeping in. He said his depression is getting worse. He does not want to see me, I feel like I am walking on eggshells because I cannot tell him how this is affecting me without him spiraling, and I just feel like I keep hurting him when I am trying my best to help him. I cannot help but think his feelings for me have changed.I love him so much for so many reasons. I loved him early on in our relationship but I wanted to be sure it was real and not infatuation, so I did not say anything until maybe 9 months in. I wish he could see what I see. But him pushing me away is hurting me and affecting my mental health now. My anxiety is through the roof and I can feel my depression starting.I am not exactly sure what I am looking for from you guys, but thanks for reading if you made it to the end. My boyfriend is pushing me away and I am at a loss",

         "Feels kind of weird posting about this on Reddit, but if it helps then I might as well.I am 16 years old, depressed, and was diagnosed with Tourette's Syndrome at age 6, along with being tested for autism multiple times (none of them came back, and I am fairly certain I am not on the spectrum, or at least not noticeably) and Asperger's once. I had an abusive stepfather for about 9 years, from when I was 3 to when I was about 11-12. I have just finished my GCSEs, and I am waiting on my grades. I have always been a high achiever, always been placed on \"gifted and talented\" lists, always used to bury myself in science textbooks and documentaries. Back before I had access to the Internet, my education was almost a coping mechanism. Still, now it feels like a lot of other people deserve their academix success a damn sight more than I do. Compared to a lot of people on this subreddit, I should be incredibly lucky. But I do not think my luck can be much worse. I am in a friends with benefits type relationship with a girl that I have loved for about 2 years, and we still love each other, but I used to talk to her about all of my depression and suicidal tendencies and now we have got a strict rule that I cannot talk to her about it anymore. Which tbf is for the best. That does not mean it does not hurt though. I guess my main problem is that I feel isolated almost all the time. Even in a room of people I feel like I am alone. Sometimes even when I am with her. Back when I had that abusive stepfather, I remember sitting in my room, in a corner, too afraid to leave or even move until my mum came home. I have grown up since then, but on the inside that is still how I feel. I have gone through countless friend groups who do not give a shit about me, I have only ever found three or four \"real\" friends yet I feel awful telling them about anything I have experienced or I am feeling. I tried to tell my teachers that they were putting me under too much stress, and then they decide to tell my mum, when I asked them not to. Queue me being treated like an alien for weeks. I have written countless rants, suicide note drafts, sad monologues, and it is getting tiring. The suicidal stuff gets terrifying sometimes... I have a massive fear of death, but I do not want to keep on living in this kind of world. I am not always suicidal, and to be honest today has been a really good day for me. But it is not like that makes it go away. Sometimes I am scared of what is going to happen to me in X amount of years. In fact, that is pretty much all of the time. As I get older, I start to realise that my childhood is slowly slipping away from me, and that I should probably enjoy what is left of it as much as I can, yet... I do not think I have ever really enjoyed my childhood. I am going to stop there, since I would be here for days otherwise. If you made it this far, thanks for reading. Typing into the void.",

         "I made a friend for the first time since middle school when covid hit I became very isolated since I was doing school online but last school year I went back in person and there was this person that would approach me but I was too shy to really talk to him and I finally built up the courage this last september to actually approach him. I've gotten really close with him and I am so fuckin glad I befriended him. He's really loving, kind and patient. He's assertive, out there and also very protective while I'm very quiet, meek and also generally on edge and easily spooked so he balances me out and calms me very well. I can tell he cares very deeply about me and he's accepting of my differences. I told him about my avpd and he has been very understanding and helpful. His attitude and actions have given me a really big confidence boost in our friendship and just in general. I feel a lot more comfortable just existing and taking up space. Even tho i still struggle a lot having a supportive and caring friend has helped me tremendously and I'm planning to keep him around for a very long time :)",

I literally just said to myself yeah, that is sad, we were good buds back in middle and high school, anyway let us moove on. A few days ago my grandmother died (corona) and once again i was not even fucking sad.. it just happened. I feel like a monster, being fucking sad and depressed because of my own fucking problems, but when something happens to someone close to me i do not fucking feel anything.

         "Male 21 years old You may not be able to understand all of this as English was not my first language.I should have lived my life happier. I choose to be alone because I always thought that you can do everything even by yourself. I ignored my friends, kept pushing that I will be ok by myself. Father left when I am just a child. Mother who worked too hard to the point where it feels like I have no parents. I got bullied when I was a kid and it made it hard for me to approach others. Even my own brother bullied me. It started when I was 8 years old. Bullying only stopped when I got to Senior High School 17 years old. Got called weird by my classmates every time. I went to different school just so I can start again but it only made it worse enough for me to attempt suicide two times. High expectation of relatives became stress and pressure for me. I had some who I should have talked to more or socialized with more but because I do not know how to, it ended with me not being able to respond making it seem like I am ignoring them and that is how I still have no friends. I always wear this fake smile on my face to not gather the attention of the teachers when I am at school. No one noticed or no one tried to ask. I tried getting help from a psychiatrist but it is not going that well. I just cannot explain why I am feeling sad or empty. I watch anime sometimes to provide myself temporary happiness but makes me feel more lonely because I have no one to talk to about things I like. I tried to befriend others but I end up talking too much and they get weirded out by me. All of this made me not want to go outside my house and made me feel like others judge me whenever they look at me. Random people I do not know why but I am scared of others stares. I do not want to be seen. I just want to disappear. I wish i could turn back time and redo all my mistakes to correct them. I wish I tried a little bit harder to get help from my relatives when i needed them. I wish I was not bullied. I wish i choose the right path that leads to happiness. Will i be able to finish my game?I always get punched. They always call me names. They steal my things. They always get away with it. When i tried to get help they told me to just ignore them and it only made it worse. Things that I tried to do:I tried overdosing on pills but my mother saved me.I tried not sleeping for 4 days and it was extremely boring but i have no one to talk to and no one cares about me so i can do whatever i want to do with myself.I tried cutting my wrist to death but was to scared of the pain. Blood looks pretty. I cut myself everyday just to see my blood and feel the pain of the cutter going through my arm.I tried to get run over by a car but they just stop and scold me.I tried to find a high place to jump from but failed.I bought rope for me todayEnd of My LifeTLDR: life sucks I want to not exist My Life",

I was CERTIAN i had bone cancer until i found out i had osteochondroma wich is a benign tumor and not life threatining. I decided not to have it removed.\n\nTwo years later (this last summer) i started have muscle twitches all over my body. Those lasted like 5 months and they still happen occasionally but mostly they've been replaced by painful/tender spots on various bones in my body including my spine.\n\nAnyways the bones in my feet hurt a lot and in my hands. Butttt basically every bone in my body has a spot where it hurts.\n\nMy pee also started burning last summer and i was tested for various STDs  and the doctor just kinda brushed it off just like he did with all of the other symptoms im describing. And idk if this is related but ive been constipated for 11 days but i can go with laxatives.\n\nI usually go to the gym but havent in a week in a half due to travel and ive actually gained 20 pounds (in muscle) over the last 6 months.\n\nWhat i really want to know is there ANY possibility that this isnt serious?\n\nAnd for those wondering i'm going to the doctor to get this checked out as soon as im back in town.\n\nAlso i stopped taking my adhd meds about a month ago that id been taking for 5 years",

I have not in a really long time, I do not even remember a time where I could accurately describe how I am feeling. There are times when I am with friends or by myself and I do not necessarily feel happy but distracted and I like that. I have heard people say, \"I keep myself busy, I do not give myself the time to be sad\" but its just more complicated than that. It is not just sadness; its anger, self-hate, and a strange emptiness I cannot describe. Even when I am out with people, speaking with them, even when I am distracting myself with some type of work, there is just this sense of hollowness.I used to be the type of person that thought things would always work out. One way or another, they had to right? They do, until they just do not anymore. Nothing works the same, and realistically I know that is because of me. There are moments, just the briefest instants of motivation I have to force things to work out. To really put shit in place and buck the fuck up, ya know? And then it just disappears and I am just at such a loss. I do not remember when I first thought it, but sometimes things just do not work out. I realized something was not right a few years ago. I have thought about death since middle school, really considered it hard but I would snap out of those funks pretty easily back then. Up until I was 20, I figured I did not think about suicide anymore than the next guy or girl. Besides what did I have to complain about? There are people that are much worse off. I was working at a bingo place at the time and was just so mentally down. I had this little post-it note that I wrote a ton of things on, they were basically ways that I would off myself if I ever had the chance to. It was meant to be kind of like an angry letter, you write it and then throw it away. Some closure or dumb shit like that. Well my manager found it and we had a pretty awkward talk. She was kind of a hard ass, the type to just bug the hell out of you over really small thing, but there were times where she was really nice. That was one of those times. Anyway, I told her that there was nothing to worry about I was just 'in a mood'. She did not tell anyone, thank fucking god, but its where I learned that thinking like that was not actually normal. I do not work there anymore, I quit not long after that. It was just too strange for me. I felt like there was always this strange look in her eye after that. I wonder if she would show up to my funeral. there is honestly a lot more I would like to share, but I do not want to make this any longer or stupid than it already is so I will wrap it up. I want to see a doctor, I need to see a doctor but they are so fucking expensive. I want medication, BUT I cannot GET IT. I do not want to feel like this anymore. I do not want to look up how I can die painlessly anymore. I do not want to debate how much longer I want to give myself anymore. I wish I lived in Sweden or somewhere that had euthanasia, that is not as scary as a gun and a rope. I want to fix my brain.I am sorry. I know stuff like this does not really help those that feel the same, but I needed to put it somewhere. I needed to exist beyond my house. I am not posting this for sympathy or pity, just for me and me alone. The same way people carve their names in trees. Although, this is much longer than a name. my brain",

         "Being a ghost would be my ideal form of existence. I really enjoy watching people live their lives, listening indirectly to their conversations while in public, being an observer of events etc. My problem is having to interfere on the world, I hate having to talk and to do things that will have consequences in it. I wish I could just watch life like a tv show or as if I was a ghost, in a way that no one could see me, nothing would be expected of me and I wouldn't need to worry because I would be certain of it. I could just contemplate the world in peace.\n\nSome of you guys may have watched Euphoria and I definitely feel a connection with the description made about Lexi, how she felt like she was an just observer and that her life was not really her life, just some sort of play or movie.\n\nThese days I been having the classic \"I want to leave all behind and live in the woods with just a dog\" idea and daydreams, and I guess that a big part of it is because I feel like there I could be like this, or at least similar enough. Be an observer of nature, never having to deal with socialization again, only brief interactions for, let's say, buy necessary stuff from other people (which I don't mind). I know this isn't realistic for my context and also that it probably wouldn't be this magical thing, but it's a fantasy that brings me satisfaction.\n\nI guess I'm just burned out of people. A lot of bad things happened in my relational and social life since childhood till last year and I'm really bitter about it right now. Of course I want to find real connection, where I could be myself openly and comfortably, but because it always goes wrong and brings disappointments I'm really hopeless at this point and honestly kinda angry. I don't have patience for people anymore, I'm tired, I'm being judgy as hell and I'm activelly avoiding new people.",

Since I usually had done only 0-30 minutes of work the previous day, I have no update to give, I panic and have to lie, and the lie is transparent. Afterwards I have to cool down from the shame, guilt, and stress. It’s already hard to recover from the procrastination because everything I do, with the code or on Slack, has a timestamp, a notification, and is visible to everyone. Once there’s something I’m avoiding (committing code, deploying code, posting the code for review, responding to someone, testing code, an upcoming meeting, etc.) I often go offline from inactivity, and then I’m afraid to even open my laptop (which can take hours to overcome) because once I do everyone can see I’m online on Slack; my procrastination then is immediately visible to the people who are impacted and who are looking for it i.e. people I’m not responding to, my manager.\n\nI already got in trouble for not doing my work, missing meetings, not responding to people for days or weeks, and just not showing up some days without telling anyone. I was put on a month-long probation, which I’ve gotten past only because I didn’t ghost entire days during that time. I have frequent meetings with my manager and I have to pretend I’m struggling way less than I am. I can’t admit that half or more of the days I do absolutely nothing, or how much communicating with people — the most important part of the job — so fundamentally terrifies me.\n\nI know every trick in the book about procrastination, time management, breaking down tasks, but that’s not enough when I’m this afraid of people. I’ve accepted I need help from another person. I’ve talked about this some with friends, but none of them understand, so all they can provide is sympathy. I have a psychiatrist and I’ve been trying to find a therapist, but they’ve all been unhelpful, many actively harmful.\n\nI know it's a slow process, but every single day at work is like torture, and I’m on very thin ice. Because I can’t get the work done, it’s not endurable, and I don’t have the time or energy to work on all the other parts of my life in dire need of work. I don’t want to quit because I haven’t been here that long and I had a big gap between quitting my previous job (for the same reasons).

We have been dating for some months.\n\nAnd I noticed that when he’s going through an anxiety “episode” or moment. He sort of physically avoids me.\n\nFor example if he feels embarrassed, or has low self esteem particularly high that moment. He will “hide” behind his laptop, or walk behind or in front of me, distancing himself physically, while still being kind, it’s more of a way of hiding from me, when he can’t actually leave. (For example when we share a hotel room on vacation)\n\nI did notice that when I grab his hand to hold mine while walking, that he does reciprocate(even when he tried to walk behind me or further away from me) but I’m not sure if he does it to please me but dislikes it, or if he likes it that I’m gently being reassuring and consistent.\n\n\nMy dear Avpd-Ers- when feeling low, do you like being comforted, or do you truly want someone to take distance and leave you alone? I just want to learn how to handle the situation so he feels comfortable!\n\nThanks everyone !!",

         "Expressing myself I feel like I’ve had a realization in the last few months that I wanted to share. It’s that one of the ways forward with this disability for me is to learn how to honestly express myself without distortion, and to do that constantly without regard for the fact that it causes me pain and discomfort.\n\n I used to cope with my issues by putting on a mask of a personality that I built using self help books and a desperate need for approval. Basically just the ‘fake it til you make it strategy’. Although I became more conventionally likable, it truly did not help in the long run as I was never able to get close to people. Now I am back to an ultimately isolated life. But I’m trying something different.\n\nIt’s very challenging to me and not always doable but I think it is necessary. And that is to view socializing as a simple and honest expression of myself between others. When I have a thought or opinion or feeling, say it, put it out there in some way (for better or worse). Also, treat what others say as true expression of their being. This may sound silly but I think it is a subtle seeming thing that is actually big deal.\n\nAs I said it’s challenging and not always doable, this is because \n1. A deeply negative emotional and sometimes physical reaction to the idea of expressing most things in my mind for fear of embarrassment or rejection.\n2. My brain going blank due to weariness and therefor not having anything to express.\n3. The fact that isolation makes me depressed and lonely so the things on my mind can bring the vibe down.\n\nBut regardless I realize that this is what I have to do, and that watching myself mindfully and purely expressing what’s on my mind is the only way forward. Usually what happens when I force something out is that I brace for impact. Brace for embarrassment, rejection, etc. Usually I assume that people are secretly embarrassed for me for whatever I said, but whether or not that is true isn’t important.\n\nI’ve been trying a lot of tools of expression such as music, writing, and drawing, and I think these are helping me learn how to express myself naturally.\n\nAnyway, I’m tired of pretending. Im not sure if I will ever be able to speak without fear and shame, but at least I won’t have to strain myself into a ‘safe’ caricature. Maybe this seems like crazy person thoughts but I hope someone relates or understands.",

First off, I’m very anxious in almost all social situations. This includes hanging around friends i’ve known for many many years, being around extended family (who i’ve also known for many years), being around coworkers, meeting new people, and even just going grocery shopping. \n\nI often try to avoid a lot of social situations which has definitely affected a lot of my relationships. I’m not very close with my friends or family anymore. I still hangout with them sometimes but it’s not on a very deep level. I don’t really open myself up to anyone. I’m scared of people figuring out my true personality and that they won’t like me for who I am. I hide lots of parts of my personality and not one person on this earth truly knows me. I’m close enough with my parents that I don’t get anxious around them, however I still hide many pieces of myself and don’t feel comfortable enough to show everything about myself. \n\nI have also struggled to find jobs that don’t make me anxious. It took me until I was 18 years old until I finally got my first job because of this. I currently work at a daycare and have worked here for about 7 months and my anxiety has seemed to get worse. I have been thinking about quitting for awhile now but am terrified of having the conversation with my boss about quitting. \n\nWhenever I’m at work, I feel inferior to everyone else. I feel like I have less experience, I overthink everything, and I am so awkward around my coworkers and parents. I feel like I’m incompetent and people don’t take me seriously because of my poor communication skills. My mind often goes blank when I’m asked questions and I don’t feel like I’m much of a help. I also try to focus completely on the kids and I would rather not form any real relationships with other coworkers. I try to keep conversations polite and small. I rarely talk about myself either, just enough to get by. I play it safe. \n\nI’ve always just felt like there was something wrong with me.

         "I'm screwed, maybe many of you are too? One thing I'm aware of is after you've been disconnected from societal norms for a few years, it seems very difficult to return. I tend to stay away from looking at other people's lives, overall it is good but you also need an awareness of how far adrift you are and the standard you're compared against.\n\nThe average person is socially active, whereas were disengaged. They have a constant stream of chores hobbies events plans, messaging circles. In a day some days I speak to no one and can't even find the motivation to do anything new, even something like watching a movie I can put off. My point is that after a while when you look at the ''activity level'' of a normal average person I just feel inadequate. This is made worse reinforced by the fact that whenever i do try connect with others I get rejected thats because they can sense pretty early I have nothing going on for myself in these social areas and I am not so much like them. And thats the catch-22 because people excluding you stops you ever having anything.\n\nI'm incapable of organising a fun life, things, like viewing someone in family gathering and getting along with large groups of people and creating a good impression, are intimidating,nearly impossible for me. I'm behind in career, life experiences, life skills, energy. It's just difficult to even get a footing, iv been cut away for so long and many types have closed the door on me",

         "Anxiety after the gym Ever since I started going to the gym , I have fallen in love with it. I look forward to it everyday as it completely distracts me from whatever it is I might be dealing with in my head. I usually go in the evening and up until then I'm fine. But I swear that drive back from the gym and when I'm sitting in my room all alone, can be extremely excruciating sometimes. The anxiety feels like a balloon going up and up into the sky, eventually it will pop and come back down. It's just an awful feeling, and I feel it almost every time now. I wonder if anyone else has felt it or knows what I'm talking about? It's such a terribly lonely feeling I get. I think what really bothers me more than anything in my life is this belief I have that I am not a good person. I mean it's not like I'm cussing people out or being a dick to anyone. It's more like I treat people like they don't matter or mean anything to me, it's an extremely shitty thing to do. Like I see a lot of the same people every day, and I think normally this would result in you forming a bond with them slowly at least. But it's not like that, everyone that's not in my immediate family just gets kept at arm's length. Even then, the relationships I do have with my family almost seem to be held up by plastic and tape.",

         "Storytime... Hey, so... I've made some realizations in the shower as I do what most of us do and plan out the conversations I'll be having in two weeks because I know it's going to happen and I need to be ready or I'll just clam up and nothing is going to happen. We've all been there, most of us are still there, let's talk about what I'm thinking about in this little vent sesh. \n\nAlright, so I was showering, thinking about how akward it's going to be when I tell my friends some secrets. Wow! I know, sharing secrets! It freaking sucks!\n\nSo basically, I'm part of a church group, and these people are closer to me than my family because I don't like/trust my family and being around them is stressful. These friends that I hang out with all the time are my safe place and they make me feel...happy really. \n\nThough I don't share everything, these people are genuine and kind, and they always make me feel safe. It's just that, I am going on a mission trip with them this summer. Going to Africa, and it took them months to convince me to come with them. I still don't like the idea of going, but knowing that I'll be with them the entire time makes me feel much better. Besides, I used to fly a lot so the plane ride will be pretty nostalgic for me.  \n\nSo, as part of going on the trip, I have to do a few things. One thing that I have to do is research a topic on one part of the trip and give a presentation to oir team (9 people including me). I trust, love, and feel safe with everyone on this team, and all but one of them have been my closest friends for almost 2 years now. I couldn't ask for better friends. \n\nAnyways, the presentation I'm giving is in two weeks and I'll be discussing the entertainment part of the trip. Basically, I just have to research what kind of entertainment there is where we're going and make a small (mostly funny) slideshow. It doesn't even have to last 5 minutes, but honestly...this presentation is the least of my anxieties in this mess. \n\nAnother thing that I'm going to have to do is share my testimony. That is essentially a summarized version of your life story. I'll have to talk about my troubles, my past, my family, all of it. And these are my friends, they'll know if I'm holding back. But it scares me so much! Half of them don't actually know I have avpd! They just know that I've been going to therapy for a while and that I started taking medicine. Though, the medicine is kind of iffy really. \n\nAnyways, I'm super anxious about it, especially since I did something similar last year, but that was at the height of my emotional suppression. This time last year, I was so empty and emotionless. But of course, nobody knew. I was always masking my emotions and faking a smile. I didn't even know I was doing it, and when I gave my testimony for last year's mission, it was incomplete and full of holes. I talked about my lack of friends, but I was blind to the emotional abuse and neglect from my parents and siblings because I had convinced myself that I was just weak and that my pain was normal and even less than what everyone else had to go through. \n\nBut it's not like that, that's not how I should think about my past pain. It took so long for my friends to break my barriers, but they managed to do that and convince me to go to therapy.\n\n I'm much better now, but I'm also not suppressing my emotions. It was really hard at first because everything just hurt so much and it overwhelmed me. One moment I was putting on a face to fool everyone into thinking I was okay, but as soon as I was behind closed doors, I was hurting myself and cursing the world for letting my life be the way it was. \n\nThe fact that I have to go and tell my friends how I've been feeling over the last year is overwhelming, but I am not allowed to go on this mission unless I share my testimony. It's only fair though, everyone of us is sharing our testimony, no matter how much it hurts, we're going to be here for each other.\n\n\nIf you've actually read this far, I just want to say thank you. You're a special type of person, and whoever is in your life is truly lucky to know someone like you. And if they don't understand that, then know that I am thanking you for the kindness you have done for me just by reading this. Thank you.",

She's a famous race car driver representing our country all over the world. She now just recently joined an F1 school. I know money and her being a nepo baby (her father was also a race car driver before) helped her achieve big things, but she also wouldn't be where she is right now if she wasn't great. \n\nI just realized that I'm 2 years older than her and I'm about to repeat my last year of highschool (i dropped out this mid school year because of mental health reasons), and I still don't even know wtf I wanna do in life. \n\nMy best friend is so fckin smart, she's studying right now to be a chemical engineer. My other best friend is also smart, all of his grade averages are 95+ (100 is the highest in my country). \n\nI'm surrounded by smart, and talented people with a future, people who will make a name for themselves and become rich in the future. People who have already carved their paths. While I'm here barely even making it through the day. I can't even go to school without wanting to off myself, while they're here working their ass off for their future.\n\nMy best friends don't even know I already dropped out of high school. I'm too embarrassed to tell them. How can I tell them? They would be too embarrassed to have a highschool dropout as a friend. What am i even doing with my life? I always avoid things, things that make me feel uncomfy or unsafe. Now look where that got me. Stuck inside the house wasting my life away. I'm gonna be 20 in october, my teen years are finally over.

         "Do you think this a good description of our experiences? This is an excerpt from the introduction of a book called *On The Outside Looking In* by Daniela Grazia, about her experiences with social anxiety. \n\nI’ve used it to describe my experiences to others, but I have both social anxiety and AvPD so I worry if I’m not explaining from the ‘correct’ side (?). I’m also a psychology student and find it interesting to try to distinguish the two. I suppose it only matters in my head, but it does matter.\n\nThe quote (one long one, formatting issues):\n&gt;“It is a feeling that comes over me often, an old menace that stubbornly refuses to die. In classes, in coffee shops, in almost any activity where surrounded by potential friends. It is the profound feeling of alienness.\n\n&gt;”At any moment in the group conversation, something in me snaps. I look around the table at the other people blissfully talking, and I do not feel like one of them. I am not one of them. I am different, a foreigner, an alien, a stranger in a strange land.\n\n&gt;”And then the urge to run away, to hide, to be away from the people comes up. Sometimes I fight the urge and stay on, hiding my vast discomfort. Other times I do run away, cursing the cowardice and the shame, miserable in my misanthropy, but secure in my solitude.\n\n&gt;”There is something in the faces, in the voices of the others that I do not have. They are into the conversation. They live outside themselves, I live inside myself. They talk, listen, and laugh; I think, listen, and smile.\n\n&gt;”They are relaxed. I am not. I am never relaxed, except when I’m alone. Solitude is the only place where I can ever truly be known.\n\n&gt;”Yet I am not content with this. For the real me is lonely, desperately lonely, longing for intimacy, friendship and love. I long to be able to relax, to laugh, to talk, and converse amiably with other human beings. But I cannot. I idealize them in private and fear them in public.\n\n&gt;”Fear...fear drives the haunted mind. Fear tortures me, gnaws at me, and chases me from nearly everything I crave the most. But not even fear can conquer the longing, the desperate longing, the aching striving for meaning in life, for something other than the endless nights alone and unhugged, the dreams unshared, the life unnoticed.\n\n&gt;”When I am alone, I wish I was other people. When I am with other people, I wish I was alone. This contradiction is slowly, but ruthlessly destroying my soul.”",

I live with my parents and I am NEET. I did not go to college. I've spent the majority of my childhood and adolescence getting some kind of therapy and/or psychiatric help, but I stopped about a year ago because I realized it was not going to help me. I have very low energy and fleeting motivation, and day to day I can't consistently do the basic tasks of caring for myself and maintaining my living space, in other words, living like an actual adult. The main reason these things are so hard for me is that when I'm doing chores and things where my mind can wander, I keep thinking about things I don't want to think about. I remember in detail the moments when people have insulted me or been cruel to me, or times when I've embarassed myself or made a mistake, for years, and I relive them constantly, and the wounds are continuously reopened and never heal. I often freeze up when these thoughts strike me and sometimes it makes me curse or say things out loud when I know I'm alone. Sometimes these thoughts can be powerful enough to ruin a good mood and ruin my day. It can make completing simple tasks so painful that I avoid them entirely and my quality of life suffers greatly and it affects the people that I live with.

Sorry, I'll try to keep it relatively short.\n\nI'm a 31-year-old male and I've never been diagnosed with AvPD, but while reading about the symptoms a month ago, things finally made sense to me why I act a certain way. I thought I just had some kind of social anxiety when I went to therapy several years ago, but I've felt that there has to be something else since I started feeling different in middle school. I've avoided people, responsibilites and have taken jobs where I can mostly avoid interpersonal communication. \n\nI do still have close friends, a great family and a girlfriend, but I still have this urge to self-isolate and be alone.

Right now, I have an opportunity to work longer at my current job and might even get a promotion 1-3 years  along the line in a position that I could basically hold for the rest of my working life.
