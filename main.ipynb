         "I have recently looked into reddit and found that this place is actually quite healthy and supportive... I did not know this place really existed... but anyways I have very little motivation to work my way up the employment ladder whether its for a career or min wage job... as I feel so very few careers are really interested in helping people. I am an out of the box thinker and I know most jobs will slice my head if I try quacking about maybe we can serve people first and then profit second...I do not think I have much to say, but I look very young for 26 and it seems that is a turn off for most girls. I initially tried being a psych communications major in college but dropped out as someone in a way handed me a red pill. Since about 6 years ago since that happened, I have been studying different sources on the internet to help me perform at my best if there ever was an opportunity that did not require a degree. But I have little faith and try to make creations and upload maybe assist others in some meaningful way and also make a return. ANYWAYYYSSSSSS I know my story does not sound so bad and I think a big chunk of life is how we perceive things versus how they actually are. I do not have a motivation to get a car or a job because my god mother pays for the rent and allows me free time to make creations, but I do not have a circle of friends that is interested in what I have to share. So I am wondering how I can make money with my stuff without paying for ads or self-promoting. I have asked myself how can I honestly make connections if I do not promote? Some people say offer your work for free and I do offer some stuff for free, but it is quite impersonal type of work and people these days are looking to eat up as much emotion as they can in order to fuel a like or a subscribe reaction. For some reason, I try to stay as impersonal as possible with all my work and it seems to kind of work against me in this type of culture. I am not very attached to specific beliefs or ideas.... so it seems like that is a free ticket for capitalism to rape me.... if this is my destiny.... then what can I do? I have thought about dying voluntarily from malnutrition going out into a rural area and just letting go from there.... but that would be a tough way to go it seems but that could also be a perception. I am not very suicidal to be honest but it comes up. But anyways, I do not really ever share this stuff and I am sorry if it sounds like I am messed up. I am not going to get help if you think I need it. I consider myself kind of an anti-capitalist/materialist but do like small talk and jokes... if anyone of any gender would like to talk and maybe become friends or just talk for a short while without small talk, you would not be ghosted. End: I really do not like how our problems in society are so obvious and yet people play fucking dumb when realizing when someone is having issues... they must be really fucking hurting if they are playing that low... there must be another level of empathy above where I am at if I cannot see that these people are actually hurting inside, but they do a good damn job of putting a smile on their face and saying another day another dollar. PS. The matrix is one of my favorite movies. 26m no degree, no job, no car, no money, live in basement / tl:dr",

         "Is it good to only focus on 1 goal? What I mean is, for example I have these goals:\n\n1. Find a good job OR start and grow a succesful company\n2. Find the one who will marry me in the future\n3. Find out which religion is the true one / read the whole bible\n\nSo my idea is, I will only work towards one goal at the same time. If I choose goal 1 and I choose to study or gain work experience, then I will not read the bible and I will not be on dating apps, because I should not overwhelm myself and risk a burn-out. If I choose goal 2, I will be very busy with dating apps and alternatives, but I will not have a job and I will not be studying. If I choose 3, I will read the bible a few hours every day, but I will not do any other productive things.\n\nWhat is the good side of this by my own thought?\n\n1. Whichever goal is the most important one, OR has to be completed the fastest, can get priority and full focus :)\n2. By only having one thing to work on, you have less risk of ending up with 0 free time, so you can avoid burn-out and instead, work at your own pace. (careful: do not get lazy)\n\nWhat is the bad side of this by my own thought?\n\n1. Spending hours everyday on the same goal only, can become boring. Some goals also do not require many hours every day: for example going to the gym. Being in the gym for 5 hours is a terrible idea, so if you have goals that require less time per day, you can actually pick 2 or 3 of these goals to fill your day.\n2. Some goals must be worked on at the same time. For example, you should not avoid studying because you're too busy with going to gym. But while you study, going to the gym is still important for your health. So I would call this an exception to this \"1 goal only\" idea.\n\nThese days it seems socially acceptable that people do 3 things at the same time: study, have a job, have a social life. Where's the free time to relax? Right it doesnt exist, and even worse, sometimes all these activities take up more than 24 hours a day, which results in someone being overwhelmed and getting behind on everything. Actually this is what I have experienced. Its not a theory, it is very real.\n\nI have a burn-out. I have been stressed 24/7 for a really long time, because I was focusing on too many things at once. I had to get my homework done, I had to spend all my free time on dating apps, I had to go to gym, etc, I had no free time left.\n\nSo my plan is to only work on one goal at once, and spend all free time as actual free time, to relax or enjoy it.\n\nQuestion : is this a good idea, or do you see any flaws with it?",

         "Last year, during the UK lockdown, was the very first time I have ever wanted to die. It got so extreme that I came off of the internet for a few days to try to heal. I did not know what caused it. I will probably never find out. But i did heal...slightly. After about 3 days I realised that I did not want to die and my suicidal thoughts were gone almost instantly but the depression was not. I have spent a year feeling nothing but numbness, guilt and anger. Nothing else. I have had to force a laugh for a year. At one point, I tried to reach out for help but because of covid, no one was there for me in school or in the community. And now I have slipped back into my depression it is numb, but it is emotionally draining. I have had to force myself to write (which is the only hobby I can peruse because my other ones are social hobbies) to which I just think 'what is the point?\". I cannot look at my body without feeling sick of the sight. it is hard to get out of bed but when I do, I just sit there and wait. there is nothing to do. Nothing to wait for. Getting in showers or baths has become so difficult that I have resorted to making a timetable of when I need to shower. I cannot be bothered pretending anymore. I am not okay.I cannot reach out for help. My parents will think I am faking it. My friends could not care in the slightest. I do not go back to school until August (which I am dreading). I do not have anyone to turn to. In all honesty, I could not name one person that I would be able to go to for help. I do not want to die but I do not see the point in living. This is a rant more than anything. This is not a sob story. I am sure quite a few people have gone through this same experience. I can just feel myself go downhill with every passing day. I have not felt raw joy since I do not know when. I cannot remember. The numbness is almost like an uncomfortable calmness and I cannot shake myself out of it. I am self destructing again",

         "I think I am depressed. I decided to type out and share some of my feelings and thoughts in order to get them off my chest and to hopefully receive some helpful advice or encouraging words from one of the people reading this.I was raised as a Christian and I was a believer until my early teenage years. Then, a relative of mine passed away, very suddenly, from cancer. She was still in her thirties. It made no sense to me. She was a very generous, sweet, hospitable, warm and loving woman. It made me question if there is a god and why he would allow something like this to happen to such a good person. The death of my relative turned me into a bit of a hedonist. My reasoning: Why would I do tedious things, if something like this can happen to anyone? What is the point in studying for a boring test when I could die tomorrow? I knew that the chances of me dying were slim, but there are never guarantees.Then, I identified as an agnostic atheist for a few years, before I finally became an atheist a few years ago. I am now at a point where I believe our existence is merely a coincidence. We are just descendants of monkeys on a tiny blue rock and the unfortunate tragedy is that we can reflect on our own existence. I am the kind of person who tries to make sense of everything. I usually try to be as unbiased as possible and to use facts in order to form my opinion. That is why it is so hard for me to come to terms with the fact that life is very unfair and random.By making smart choices (living healthily, working hard, etc.), you can only increase your chances of living a good life, but there are no guarantees. Our 1 and only life is a game of chance, which is a truth that is hard for me to fathom.The state of the world pisses me off too. Why the fuck is there still racism? Why are LGBTQIA+ people still being treated unfairly? Why are we allowing capitalism, overconsumption and greed to completely destroy our planet? Why are there billionaires? Why are millions of people starving, while others care about buying the latest clothes and gadgets? How am I supposed to care about school when these problems still exist? Perhaps I am just a sensitive little bitch, idk.Speaking of being a bitch, I fucking love my parents and I cannot stomach that someday, they will die. I start crying even just thinking about losing them at some point in the future. I genuinely believe they are some of the best human beings on the earth. I have thought about suicide but I do not think I would be able to do that to my parents, who are my everything. So the harsh reality is that either I will lose them, or they will lose me. So, if I do not want to commit suicide, it is inevitable that I will lose my parents at some point (if I manage to live that long) and that I will have to continue to live life on a planet full of greed and hate. A life that is inextricably linked to suffering. I have heard people say time and time again that life IS suffering, but even when that is seen as a universal truth, that does not mean that it becomes easier to accept that truth. That truth does not suddenly become easier to bear.I have briefly read about Camus (and the myth of Sisyphus) and while I agree with his worldviews and the absurdity of life, I cannot really see myself following the example of Sisyphus. I cannot see how I could accept having to roll the boulder up the hill for the rest of my life.For a few years, the idea of building a legacy intrigued me. What if I could make art or start institutions that could stand the test of time. My name would be cemented in history. Then, I had a shocking realisation. When I die, I will not be there to enjoy the legacy I built. I do not know what to do. I still enjoy sports, hedonism and other forms of escapism, but only because they allow me a temporary escape from life's inherent suffering. Perhaps I am a 'pussy' or a 'coward' but I honestly cannot take it anymore. This existence is overwhelming. Fed up with this unfair and cruel world and life's inherent suffering",

         "TLDR; bf is getting more depressed over time. I am trying so hard to get him the help he needs. I am getting pushed away and its affecting my mental health now. I feel like everything is pointing towards us breaking up.we have been dating for about 1.5 years. I have GAD and moderate/mild depression. I am currently on medications and in therapy. He has severe depression (and anxiety I suspect), and has been in therapy before. Hes going back to therapy, but there were not any availabilities until August. He has a history of getting depressed in relationships (previous two gfs and me).He and I have similar histories. Both our families had pretty nasty divorces. Both of our mothers developed cancer while we were still young teenagers. Our families are in similar geographic regions. We both had a relationship that was emotionally abusive. I guess I mention these because it was easy for us to understand each other when we first met, but also because I think these could have impacted our mental developments and relationships.Both my partner and I are in graduate school. He has a major exam coming up that determines if he will qualify for candidacy. This exam has been looming for a while and has been pushed back a couple of times because of COVID, but also because he was not prioritizing preparing for it. This stressor is contributing to his depression.The other stressor is our relationship. Its been on the rocks for a couple of months now. He left to visit family in May and he was not in the mood to have sex when he came back. I miss the sexual intimacy, but I am much prefer physical affection and emotional intimacy. Having said that, its always been hard for him to open up to me. In June, he did something that really upset me at the time, which started his spiraling. I have since forgiven him, but I do not think hes forgiven himself. He admitted hes been depressed for a while now. I did not see the signs very well and attributed it to stress from his exam (before I knew our relationship was also stressing him out). He said a lot of self-hate things and started punching himself in the face. I called his dad and told him what is going on because I felt like I could not be his only support. we have been in limbo (how he described it) since June. We did not see each other much the first couple of weeks because we both needed space. After that, I have been the one initiating contact and hanging out to get a feel for things. we have been telling we love and miss each other still. However, he told me this weekend that the physical affection is hurting him and he was not comfortable with me going to our mutual friends because he cannot be a boyfriend right now. For 4th of July, he also did not act like my boyfriend.This really hurt me but I have been trying to listen to his needs more because of his depression. Hes asked for more space to focus on school, which also hurts but I do the same when I need to get work done. I have tried to get him into our schools counseling between now and his regular therapist, but he does not want to talk to a new therapist. I have also tried to get him to couples therapy. He said he would go, but its obvious he does not want to be there, so I have not scheduled anything because I do not think it would be productive if he does not want to be there. I have asked if I can help him around his house because he is not taking care of himself. I have asked how can I support him, which was the space mentioned above.He does not know what he wants in regards to us. I do not know if its the depression talking. Hes scared if we have an on and off relationship that I will eventually leave him for good because an ex did that. Hes thinks I am disappointed in him (I have never said this, he sets these expectations for himself) because he cannot be a boyfriend right now. I feel he does love me because 1) friends and his family have told me he loves and cares about me very much, 2) he showed it through his actions before all of this, 3) he told me he loves making me happy. But, my doubts have been creeping in. He said his depression is getting worse. He does not want to see me, I feel like I am walking on eggshells because I cannot tell him how this is affecting me without him spiraling, and I just feel like I keep hurting him when I am trying my best to help him. I cannot help but think his feelings for me have changed.I love him so much for so many reasons. I loved him early on in our relationship but I wanted to be sure it was real and not infatuation, so I did not say anything until maybe 9 months in. I wish he could see what I see. But him pushing me away is hurting me and affecting my mental health now. My anxiety is through the roof and I can feel my depression starting.I am not exactly sure what I am looking for from you guys, but thanks for reading if you made it to the end. My boyfriend is pushing me away and I am at a loss",

         "Feels kind of weird posting about this on Reddit, but if it helps then I might as well.I am 16 years old, depressed, and was diagnosed with Tourette's Syndrome at age 6, along with being tested for autism multiple times (none of them came back, and I am fairly certain I am not on the spectrum, or at least not noticeably) and Asperger's once. I had an abusive stepfather for about 9 years, from when I was 3 to when I was about 11-12. I have just finished my GCSEs, and I am waiting on my grades. I have always been a high achiever, always been placed on \"gifted and talented\" lists, always used to bury myself in science textbooks and documentaries. Back before I had access to the Internet, my education was almost a coping mechanism. Still, now it feels like a lot of other people deserve their academix success a damn sight more than I do. Compared to a lot of people on this subreddit, I should be incredibly lucky. But I do not think my luck can be much worse. I am in a friends with benefits type relationship with a girl that I have loved for about 2 years, and we still love each other, but I used to talk to her about all of my depression and suicidal tendencies and now we have got a strict rule that I cannot talk to her about it anymore. Which tbf is for the best. That does not mean it does not hurt though. I guess my main problem is that I feel isolated almost all the time. Even in a room of people I feel like I am alone. Sometimes even when I am with her. Back when I had that abusive stepfather, I remember sitting in my room, in a corner, too afraid to leave or even move until my mum came home. I have grown up since then, but on the inside that is still how I feel. I have gone through countless friend groups who do not give a shit about me, I have only ever found three or four \"real\" friends yet I feel awful telling them about anything I have experienced or I am feeling. I tried to tell my teachers that they were putting me under too much stress, and then they decide to tell my mum, when I asked them not to. Queue me being treated like an alien for weeks. I have written countless rants, suicide note drafts, sad monologues, and it is getting tiring. The suicidal stuff gets terrifying sometimes... I have a massive fear of death, but I do not want to keep on living in this kind of world. I am not always suicidal, and to be honest today has been a really good day for me. But it is not like that makes it go away. Sometimes I am scared of what is going to happen to me in X amount of years. In fact, that is pretty much all of the time. As I get older, I start to realise that my childhood is slowly slipping away from me, and that I should probably enjoy what is left of it as much as I can, yet... I do not think I have ever really enjoyed my childhood. I am going to stop there, since I would be here for days otherwise. If you made it this far, thanks for reading. Typing into the void.",

         "I made a friend for the first time since middle school when covid hit I became very isolated since I was doing school online but last school year I went back in person and there was this person that would approach me but I was too shy to really talk to him and I finally built up the courage this last september to actually approach him. I've gotten really close with him and I am so fuckin glad I befriended him. He's really loving, kind and patient. He's assertive, out there and also very protective while I'm very quiet, meek and also generally on edge and easily spooked so he balances me out and calms me very well. I can tell he cares very deeply about me and he's accepting of my differences. I told him about my avpd and he has been very understanding and helpful. His attitude and actions have given me a really big confidence boost in our friendship and just in general. I feel a lot more comfortable just existing and taking up space. Even tho i still struggle a lot having a supportive and caring friend has helped me tremendously and I'm planning to keep him around for a very long time :)",

I literally just said to myself yeah, that is sad, we were good buds back in middle and high school, anyway let us moove on. A few days ago my grandmother died (corona) and once again i was not even fucking sad.. it just happened. I feel like a monster, being fucking sad and depressed because of my own fucking problems, but when something happens to someone close to me i do not fucking feel anything.

         "Male 21 years old You may not be able to understand all of this as English was not my first language.I should have lived my life happier. I choose to be alone because I always thought that you can do everything even by yourself. I ignored my friends, kept pushing that I will be ok by myself. Father left when I am just a child. Mother who worked too hard to the point where it feels like I have no parents. I got bullied when I was a kid and it made it hard for me to approach others. Even my own brother bullied me. It started when I was 8 years old. Bullying only stopped when I got to Senior High School 17 years old. Got called weird by my classmates every time. I went to different school just so I can start again but it only made it worse enough for me to attempt suicide two times. High expectation of relatives became stress and pressure for me. I had some who I should have talked to more or socialized with more but because I do not know how to, it ended with me not being able to respond making it seem like I am ignoring them and that is how I still have no friends. I always wear this fake smile on my face to not gather the attention of the teachers when I am at school. No one noticed or no one tried to ask. I tried getting help from a psychiatrist but it is not going that well. I just cannot explain why I am feeling sad or empty. I watch anime sometimes to provide myself temporary happiness but makes me feel more lonely because I have no one to talk to about things I like. I tried to befriend others but I end up talking too much and they get weirded out by me. All of this made me not want to go outside my house and made me feel like others judge me whenever they look at me. Random people I do not know why but I am scared of others stares. I do not want to be seen. I just want to disappear. I wish i could turn back time and redo all my mistakes to correct them. I wish I tried a little bit harder to get help from my relatives when i needed them. I wish I was not bullied. I wish i choose the right path that leads to happiness. Will i be able to finish my game?I always get punched. They always call me names. They steal my things. They always get away with it. When i tried to get help they told me to just ignore them and it only made it worse. Things that I tried to do:I tried overdosing on pills but my mother saved me.I tried not sleeping for 4 days and it was extremely boring but i have no one to talk to and no one cares about me so i can do whatever i want to do with myself.I tried cutting my wrist to death but was to scared of the pain. Blood looks pretty. I cut myself everyday just to see my blood and feel the pain of the cutter going through my arm.I tried to get run over by a car but they just stop and scold me.I tried to find a high place to jump from but failed.I bought rope for me todayEnd of My LifeTLDR: life sucks I want to not exist My Life",

I was CERTIAN i had bone cancer until i found out i had osteochondroma wich is a benign tumor and not life threatining. I decided not to have it removed.\n\nTwo years later (this last summer) i started have muscle twitches all over my body. Those lasted like 5 months and they still happen occasionally but mostly they've been replaced by painful/tender spots on various bones in my body including my spine.\n\nAnyways the bones in my feet hurt a lot and in my hands. Butttt basically every bone in my body has a spot where it hurts.\n\nMy pee also started burning last summer and i was tested for various STDs  and the doctor just kinda brushed it off just like he did with all of the other symptoms im describing. And idk if this is related but ive been constipated for 11 days but i can go with laxatives.\n\nI usually go to the gym but havent in a week in a half due to travel and ive actually gained 20 pounds (in muscle) over the last 6 months.\n\nWhat i really want to know is there ANY possibility that this isnt serious?\n\nAnd for those wondering i'm going to the doctor to get this checked out as soon as im back in town.\n\nAlso i stopped taking my adhd meds about a month ago that id been taking for 5 years",

         "This is kind of just ganna be a thought dump I guess, but its something I need to put somewhere so it is not festering in my head.I do not really understand myself anymore. I have not in a really long time, I do not even remember a time where I could accurately describe how I am feeling. There are times when I am with friends or by myself and I do not necessarily feel happy but distracted and I like that. I have heard people say, \"I keep myself busy, I do not give myself the time to be sad\" but its just more complicated than that. It is not just sadness; its anger, self-hate, and a strange emptiness I cannot describe. Even when I am out with people, speaking with them, even when I am distracting myself with some type of work, there is just this sense of hollowness.I used to be the type of person that thought things would always work out. One way or another, they had to right? They do, until they just do not anymore. Nothing works the same, and realistically I know that is because of me. There are moments, just the briefest instants of motivation I have to force things to work out. To really put shit in place and buck the fuck up, ya know? And then it just disappears and I am just at such a loss. I do not remember when I first thought it, but sometimes things just do not work out. I realized something was not right a few years ago. I have thought about death since middle school, really considered it hard but I would snap out of those funks pretty easily back then. Up until I was 20, I figured I did not think about suicide anymore than the next guy or girl. Besides what did I have to complain about? There are people that are much worse off. I was working at a bingo place at the time and was just so mentally down. I had this little post-it note that I wrote a ton of things on, they were basically ways that I would off myself if I ever had the chance to. It was meant to be kind of like an angry letter, you write it and then throw it away. Some closure or dumb shit like that. Well my manager found it and we had a pretty awkward talk. She was kind of a hard ass, the type to just bug the hell out of you over really small thing, but there were times where she was really nice. That was one of those times. Anyway, I told her that there was nothing to worry about I was just 'in a mood'. She did not tell anyone, thank fucking god, but its where I learned that thinking like that was not actually normal. I do not work there anymore, I quit not long after that. It was just too strange for me. I felt like there was always this strange look in her eye after that. I wonder if she would show up to my funeral. there is honestly a lot more I would like to share, but I do not want to make this any longer or stupid than it already is so I will wrap it up. I want to see a doctor, I need to see a doctor but they are so fucking expensive. I want medication, BUT I cannot GET IT. I do not want to feel like this anymore. I do not want to look up how I can die painlessly anymore. I do not want to debate how much longer I want to give myself anymore. I wish I lived in Sweden or somewhere that had euthanasia, that is not as scary as a gun and a rope. I want to fix my brain.I am sorry. I know stuff like this does not really help those that feel the same, but I needed to put it somewhere. I needed to exist beyond my house. I am not posting this for sympathy or pity, just for me and me alone. The same way people carve their names in trees. Although, this is much longer than a name. my brain",

         "I have recently looked into reddit and found that this place is actually quite healthy and supportive... I did not know this place really existed... but anyways I have very little motivation to work my way up the employment ladder whether its for a career or min wage job... as I feel so very few careers are really interested in helping people. I am an out of the box thinker and I know most jobs will slice my head if I try quacking about maybe we can serve people first and then profit second...I do not think I have much to say, but I look very young for 26 and it seems that is a turn off for most girls. I initially tried being a psych communications major in college but dropped out as someone in a way handed me a red pill. Since about 6 years ago since that happened, I have been studying different sources on the internet to help me perform at my best if there ever was an opportunity that did not require a degree. But I have little faith and try to make creations and upload maybe assist others in some meaningful way and also make a return. ANYWAYYYSSSSSS I know my story does not sound so bad and I think a big chunk of life is how we perceive things versus how they actually are. I do not have a motivation to get a car or a job because my god mother pays for the rent and allows me free time to make creations, but I do not have a circle of friends that is interested in what I have to share. So I am wondering how I can make money with my stuff without paying for ads or self-promoting. I have asked myself how can I honestly make connections if I do not promote? Some people say offer your work for free and I do offer some stuff for free, but it is quite impersonal type of work and people these days are looking to eat up as much emotion as they can in order to fuel a like or a subscribe reaction. For some reason, I try to stay as impersonal as possible with all my work and it seems to kind of work against me in this type of culture. I am not very attached to specific beliefs or ideas.... so it seems like that is a free ticket for capitalism to rape me.... if this is my destiny.... then what can I do? I have thought about dying voluntarily from malnutrition going out into a rural area and just letting go from there.... but that would be a tough way to go it seems but that could also be a perception. I am not very suicidal to be honest but it comes up. But anyways, I do not really ever share this stuff and I am sorry if it sounds like I am messed up. I am not going to get help if you think I need it. I consider myself kind of an anti-capitalist/materialist but do like small talk and jokes... if anyone of any gender would like to talk and maybe become friends or just talk for a short while without small talk, you would not be ghosted. End: I really do not like how our problems in society are so obvious and yet people play fucking dumb when realizing when someone is having issues... they must be really fucking hurting if they are playing that low... there must be another level of empathy above where I am at if I cannot see that these people are actually hurting inside, but they do a good damn job of putting a smile on their face and saying another day another dollar. PS. The matrix is one of my favorite movies. 26m no degree, no job, no car, no money, live in basement / tl:dr",

         "Is it good to only focus on 1 goal? What I mean is, for example I have these goals:\n\n1. Find a good job OR start and grow a succesful company\n2. Find the one who will marry me in the future\n3. Find out which religion is the true one / read the whole bible\n\nSo my idea is, I will only work towards one goal at the same time. If I choose goal 1 and I choose to study or gain work experience, then I will not read the bible and I will not be on dating apps, because I should not overwhelm myself and risk a burn-out. If I choose goal 2, I will be very busy with dating apps and alternatives, but I will not have a job and I will not be studying. If I choose 3, I will read the bible a few hours every day, but I will not do any other productive things.\n\nWhat is the good side of this by my own thought?\n\n1. Whichever goal is the most important one, OR has to be completed the fastest, can get priority and full focus :)\n2. By only having one thing to work on, you have less risk of ending up with 0 free time, so you can avoid burn-out and instead, work at your own pace. (careful: do not get lazy)\n\nWhat is the bad side of this by my own thought?\n\n1. Spending hours everyday on the same goal only, can become boring. Some goals also do not require many hours every day: for example going to the gym. Being in the gym for 5 hours is a terrible idea, so if you have goals that require less time per day, you can actually pick 2 or 3 of these goals to fill your day.\n2. Some goals must be worked on at the same time. For example, you should not avoid studying because you're too busy with going to gym. But while you study, going to the gym is still important for your health. So I would call this an exception to this \"1 goal only\" idea.\n\nThese days it seems socially acceptable that people do 3 things at the same time: study, have a job, have a social life. Where's the free time to relax? Right it doesnt exist, and even worse, sometimes all these activities take up more than 24 hours a day, which results in someone being overwhelmed and getting behind on everything. Actually this is what I have experienced. Its not a theory, it is very real.\n\nI have a burn-out. I have been stressed 24/7 for a really long time, because I was focusing on too many things at once. I had to get my homework done, I had to spend all my free time on dating apps, I had to go to gym, etc, I had no free time left.\n\nSo my plan is to only work on one goal at once, and spend all free time as actual free time, to relax or enjoy it.\n\nQuestion : is this a good idea, or do you see any flaws with it?",

         "Last year, during the UK lockdown, was the very first time I have ever wanted to die. It got so extreme that I came off of the internet for a few days to try to heal. I did not know what caused it. I will probably never find out. But i did heal...slightly. After about 3 days I realised that I did not want to die and my suicidal thoughts were gone almost instantly but the depression was not. I have spent a year feeling nothing but numbness, guilt and anger. Nothing else. I have had to force a laugh for a year. At one point, I tried to reach out for help but because of covid, no one was there for me in school or in the community. And now I have slipped back into my depression it is numb, but it is emotionally draining. I have had to force myself to write (which is the only hobby I can peruse because my other ones are social hobbies) to which I just think 'what is the point?\". I cannot look at my body without feeling sick of the sight. it is hard to get out of bed but when I do, I just sit there and wait. there is nothing to do. Nothing to wait for. Getting in showers or baths has become so difficult that I have resorted to making a timetable of when I need to shower. I cannot be bothered pretending anymore. I am not okay.I cannot reach out for help. My parents will think I am faking it. My friends could not care in the slightest. I do not go back to school until August (which I am dreading). I do not have anyone to turn to. In all honesty, I could not name one person that I would be able to go to for help. I do not want to die but I do not see the point in living. This is a rant more than anything. This is not a sob story. I am sure quite a few people have gone through this same experience. I can just feel myself go downhill with every passing day. I have not felt raw joy since I do not know when. I cannot remember. The numbness is almost like an uncomfortable calmness and I cannot shake myself out of it. I am self destructing again",

         "I think I am depressed. I decided to type out and share some of my feelings and thoughts in order to get them off my chest and to hopefully receive some helpful advice or encouraging words from one of the people reading this.I was raised as a Christian and I was a believer until my early teenage years. Then, a relative of mine passed away, very suddenly, from cancer. She was still in her thirties. It made no sense to me. She was a very generous, sweet, hospitable, warm and loving woman. It made me question if there is a god and why he would allow something like this to happen to such a good person. The death of my relative turned me into a bit of a hedonist. My reasoning: Why would I do tedious things, if something like this can happen to anyone? What is the point in studying for a boring test when I could die tomorrow? I knew that the chances of me dying were slim, but there are never guarantees.Then, I identified as an agnostic atheist for a few years, before I finally became an atheist a few years ago. I am now at a point where I believe our existence is merely a coincidence. We are just descendants of monkeys on a tiny blue rock and the unfortunate tragedy is that we can reflect on our own existence. I am the kind of person who tries to make sense of everything. I usually try to be as unbiased as possible and to use facts in order to form my opinion. That is why it is so hard for me to come to terms with the fact that life is very unfair and random.By making smart choices (living healthily, working hard, etc.), you can only increase your chances of living a good life, but there are no guarantees. Our 1 and only life is a game of chance, which is a truth that is hard for me to fathom.The state of the world pisses me off too. Why the fuck is there still racism? Why are LGBTQIA+ people still being treated unfairly? Why are we allowing capitalism, overconsumption and greed to completely destroy our planet? Why are there billionaires? Why are millions of people starving, while others care about buying the latest clothes and gadgets? How am I supposed to care about school when these problems still exist? Perhaps I am just a sensitive little bitch, idk.Speaking of being a bitch, I fucking love my parents and I cannot stomach that someday, they will die. I start crying even just thinking about losing them at some point in the future. I genuinely believe they are some of the best human beings on the earth. I have thought about suicide but I do not think I would be able to do that to my parents, who are my everything. So the harsh reality is that either I will lose them, or they will lose me. So, if I do not want to commit suicide, it is inevitable that I will lose my parents at some point (if I manage to live that long) and that I will have to continue to live life on a planet full of greed and hate. A life that is inextricably linked to suffering. I have heard people say time and time again that life IS suffering, but even when that is seen as a universal truth, that does not mean that it becomes easier to accept that truth. That truth does not suddenly become easier to bear.I have briefly read about Camus (and the myth of Sisyphus) and while I agree with his worldviews and the absurdity of life, I cannot really see myself following the example of Sisyphus. I cannot see how I could accept having to roll the boulder up the hill for the rest of my life.For a few years, the idea of building a legacy intrigued me. What if I could make art or start institutions that could stand the test of time. My name would be cemented in history. Then, I had a shocking realisation. When I die, I will not be there to enjoy the legacy I built. I do not know what to do. I still enjoy sports, hedonism and other forms of escapism, but only because they allow me a temporary escape from life's inherent suffering. Perhaps I am a 'pussy' or a 'coward' but I honestly cannot take it anymore. This existence is overwhelming. Fed up with this unfair and cruel world and life's inherent suffering",

         "TLDR; bf is getting more depressed over time. I am trying so hard to get him the help he needs. I am getting pushed away and its affecting my mental health now. I feel like everything is pointing towards us breaking up.we have been dating for about 1.5 years. I have GAD and moderate/mild depression. I am currently on medications and in therapy. He has severe depression (and anxiety I suspect), and has been in therapy before. Hes going back to therapy, but there were not any availabilities until August. He has a history of getting depressed in relationships (previous two gfs and me).He and I have similar histories. Both our families had pretty nasty divorces. Both of our mothers developed cancer while we were still young teenagers. Our families are in similar geographic regions. We both had a relationship that was emotionally abusive. I guess I mention these because it was easy for us to understand each other when we first met, but also because I think these could have impacted our mental developments and relationships.Both my partner and I are in graduate school. He has a major exam coming up that determines if he will qualify for candidacy. This exam has been looming for a while and has been pushed back a couple of times because of COVID, but also because he was not prioritizing preparing for it. This stressor is contributing to his depression.The other stressor is our relationship. Its been on the rocks for a couple of months now. He left to visit family in May and he was not in the mood to have sex when he came back. I miss the sexual intimacy, but I am much prefer physical affection and emotional intimacy. Having said that, its always been hard for him to open up to me. In June, he did something that really upset me at the time, which started his spiraling. I have since forgiven him, but I do not think hes forgiven himself. He admitted hes been depressed for a while now. I did not see the signs very well and attributed it to stress from his exam (before I knew our relationship was also stressing him out). He said a lot of self-hate things and started punching himself in the face. I called his dad and told him what is going on because I felt like I could not be his only support. we have been in limbo (how he described it) since June. We did not see each other much the first couple of weeks because we both needed space. After that, I have been the one initiating contact and hanging out to get a feel for things. we have been telling we love and miss each other still. However, he told me this weekend that the physical affection is hurting him and he was not comfortable with me going to our mutual friends because he cannot be a boyfriend right now. For 4th of July, he also did not act like my boyfriend.This really hurt me but I have been trying to listen to his needs more because of his depression. Hes asked for more space to focus on school, which also hurts but I do the same when I need to get work done. I have tried to get him into our schools counseling between now and his regular therapist, but he does not want to talk to a new therapist. I have also tried to get him to couples therapy. He said he would go, but its obvious he does not want to be there, so I have not scheduled anything because I do not think it would be productive if he does not want to be there. I have asked if I can help him around his house because he is not taking care of himself. I have asked how can I support him, which was the space mentioned above.He does not know what he wants in regards to us. I do not know if its the depression talking. Hes scared if we have an on and off relationship that I will eventually leave him for good because an ex did that. Hes thinks I am disappointed in him (I have never said this, he sets these expectations for himself) because he cannot be a boyfriend right now. I feel he does love me because 1) friends and his family have told me he loves and cares about me very much, 2) he showed it through his actions before all of this, 3) he told me he loves making me happy. But, my doubts have been creeping in. He said his depression is getting worse. He does not want to see me, I feel like I am walking on eggshells because I cannot tell him how this is affecting me without him spiraling, and I just feel like I keep hurting him when I am trying my best to help him. I cannot help but think his feelings for me have changed.I love him so much for so many reasons. I loved him early on in our relationship but I wanted to be sure it was real and not infatuation, so I did not say anything until maybe 9 months in. I wish he could see what I see. But him pushing me away is hurting me and affecting my mental health now. My anxiety is through the roof and I can feel my depression starting.I am not exactly sure what I am looking for from you guys, but thanks for reading if you made it to the end. My boyfriend is pushing me away and I am at a loss",

         "Feels kind of weird posting about this on Reddit, but if it helps then I might as well.I am 16 years old, depressed, and was diagnosed with Tourette's Syndrome at age 6, along with being tested for autism multiple times (none of them came back, and I am fairly certain I am not on the spectrum, or at least not noticeably) and Asperger's once. I had an abusive stepfather for about 9 years, from when I was 3 to when I was about 11-12. I have just finished my GCSEs, and I am waiting on my grades. I have always been a high achiever, always been placed on \"gifted and talented\" lists, always used to bury myself in science textbooks and documentaries. Back before I had access to the Internet, my education was almost a coping mechanism. Still, now it feels like a lot of other people deserve their academix success a damn sight more than I do. Compared to a lot of people on this subreddit, I should be incredibly lucky. But I do not think my luck can be much worse. I am in a friends with benefits type relationship with a girl that I have loved for about 2 years, and we still love each other, but I used to talk to her about all of my depression and suicidal tendencies and now we have got a strict rule that I cannot talk to her about it anymore. Which tbf is for the best. That does not mean it does not hurt though. I guess my main problem is that I feel isolated almost all the time. Even in a room of people I feel like I am alone. Sometimes even when I am with her. Back when I had that abusive stepfather, I remember sitting in my room, in a corner, too afraid to leave or even move until my mum came home. I have grown up since then, but on the inside that is still how I feel. I have gone through countless friend groups who do not give a shit about me, I have only ever found three or four \"real\" friends yet I feel awful telling them about anything I have experienced or I am feeling. I tried to tell my teachers that they were putting me under too much stress, and then they decide to tell my mum, when I asked them not to. Queue me being treated like an alien for weeks. I have written countless rants, suicide note drafts, sad monologues, and it is getting tiring. The suicidal stuff gets terrifying sometimes... I have a massive fear of death, but I do not want to keep on living in this kind of world. I am not always suicidal, and to be honest today has been a really good day for me. But it is not like that makes it go away. Sometimes I am scared of what is going to happen to me in X amount of years. In fact, that is pretty much all of the time. As I get older, I start to realise that my childhood is slowly slipping away from me, and that I should probably enjoy what is left of it as much as I can, yet... I do not think I have ever really enjoyed my childhood. I am going to stop there, since I would be here for days otherwise. If you made it this far, thanks for reading. Typing into the void.",

I've gotten really close with him and I am so fuckin glad I befriended him. He's really loving, kind and patient. He's assertive, out there and also very protective while I'm very quiet, meek and also generally on edge and easily spooked so he balances me out and calms me very well. I can tell he cares very deeply about me and he's accepting of my differences. I told him about my avpd and he has been very understanding and helpful. His attitude and actions have given me a really big confidence boost in our friendship and just in general. I feel a lot more comfortable just existing and taking up space. Even tho i still struggle a lot having a supportive and caring friend has helped me tremendously and I'm planning to keep him around for a very long time :)",

         "Male 21 years old You may not be able to understand all of this as English was not my first language.I should have lived my life happier. I choose to be alone because I always thought that you can do everything even by yourself. I ignored my friends, kept pushing that I will be ok by myself. Father left when I am just a child. Mother who worked too hard to the point where it feels like I have no parents. I got bullied when I was a kid and it made it hard for me to approach others. Even my own brother bullied me. It started when I was 8 years old. Bullying only stopped when I got to Senior High School 17 years old. Got called weird by my classmates every time. I went to different school just so I can start again but it only made it worse enough for me to attempt suicide two times. High expectation of relatives became stress and pressure for me. I had some who I should have talked to more or socialized with more but because I do not know how to, it ended with me not being able to respond making it seem like I am ignoring them and that is how I still have no friends. I always wear this fake smile on my face to not gather the attention of the teachers when I am at school. No one noticed or no one tried to ask. I tried getting help from a psychiatrist but it is not going that well. I just cannot explain why I am feeling sad or empty. I watch anime sometimes to provide myself temporary happiness but makes me feel more lonely because I have no one to talk to about things I like. I tried to befriend others but I end up talking too much and they get weirded out by me. All of this made me not want to go outside my house and made me feel like others judge me whenever they look at me. Random people I do not know why but I am scared of others stares. I do not want to be seen. I just want to disappear. I wish i could turn back time and redo all my mistakes to correct them. I wish I tried a little bit harder to get help from my relatives when i needed them. I wish I was not bullied. I wish i choose the right path that leads to happiness. Will i be able to finish my game?I always get punched. They always call me names. They steal my things. They always get away with it. When i tried to get help they told me to just ignore them and it only made it worse. Things that I tried to do:I tried overdosing on pills but my mother saved me.I tried not sleeping for 4 days and it was extremely boring but i have no one to talk to and no one cares about me so i can do whatever i want to do with myself.I tried cutting my wrist to death but was to scared of the pain. Blood looks pretty. I cut myself everyday just to see my blood and feel the pain of the cutter going through my arm.I tried to get run over by a car but they just stop and scold me.I tried to find a high place to jump from but failed.I bought rope for me todayEnd of My LifeTLDR: life sucks I want to not exist My Life",

I was CERTIAN i had bone cancer until i found out i had osteochondroma wich is a benign tumor and not life threatining. I decided not to have it removed.\n\nTwo years later (this last summer) i started have muscle twitches all over my body. Those lasted like 5 months and they still happen occasionally but mostly they've been replaced by painful/tender spots on various bones in my body including my spine.\n\nAnyways the bones in my feet hurt a lot and in my hands. Butttt basically every bone in my body has a spot where it hurts.\n\nMy pee also started burning last summer and i was tested for various STDs  and the doctor just kinda brushed it off just like he did with all of the other symptoms im describing. And idk if this is related but ive been constipated for 11 days but i can go with laxatives.\n\nI usually go to the gym but havent in a week in a half due to travel and ive actually gained 20 pounds (in muscle) over the last 6 months.\n\nWhat i really want to know is there ANY possibility that this isnt serious?\n\nAnd for those wondering i'm going to the doctor to get this checked out as soon as im back in town.\n\nAlso i stopped taking my adhd meds about a month ago that id been taking for 5 years",

I have not in a really long time, I do not even remember a time where I could accurately describe how I am feeling. There are times when I am with friends or by myself and I do not necessarily feel happy but distracted and I like that. I have heard people say, \"I keep myself busy, I do not give myself the time to be sad\" but its just more complicated than that. It is not just sadness; its anger, self-hate, and a strange emptiness I cannot describe. Even when I am out with people, speaking with them, even when I am distracting myself with some type of work, there is just this sense of hollowness.I used to be the type of person that thought things would always work out. One way or another, they had to right? They do, until they just do not anymore. Nothing works the same, and realistically I know that is because of me. There are moments, just the briefest instants of motivation I have to force things to work out. To really put shit in place and buck the fuck up, ya know? And then it just disappears and I am just at such a loss. I do not remember when I first thought it, but sometimes things just do not work out. I realized something was not right a few years ago. I have thought about death since middle school, really considered it hard but I would snap out of those funks pretty easily back then. Up until I was 20, I figured I did not think about suicide anymore than the next guy or girl. Besides what did I have to complain about? There are people that are much worse off. I was working at a bingo place at the time and was just so mentally down. I had this little post-it note that I wrote a ton of things on, they were basically ways that I would off myself if I ever had the chance to. It was meant to be kind of like an angry letter, you write it and then throw it away. Some closure or dumb shit like that. Well my manager found it and we had a pretty awkward talk. She was kind of a hard ass, the type to just bug the hell out of you over really small thing, but there were times where she was really nice. That was one of those times. Anyway, I told her that there was nothing to worry about I was just 'in a mood'. She did not tell anyone, thank fucking god, but its where I learned that thinking like that was not actually normal. I do not work there anymore, I quit not long after that. It was just too strange for me. I felt like there was always this strange look in her eye after that. I wonder if she would show up to my funeral. there is honestly a lot more I would like to share, but I do not want to make this any longer or stupid than it already is so I will wrap it up. I want to see a doctor, I need to see a doctor but they are so fucking expensive. I want medication, BUT I cannot GET IT. I do not want to feel like this anymore. I do not want to look up how I can die painlessly anymore. I do not want to debate how much longer I want to give myself anymore. I wish I lived in Sweden or somewhere that had euthanasia, that is not as scary as a gun and a rope. I want to fix my brain.I am sorry. I know stuff like this does not really help those that feel the same, but I needed to put it somewhere. I needed to exist beyond my house. I am not posting this for sympathy or pity, just for me and me alone. The same way people carve their names in trees. Although, this is much longer than a name. my brain",

Within the first 3 weeks I realised the course was not for me. I told my mom hoping to get some support. Instead she texted my older brother who started saying I am stressing my mum out and that I have not given it a proper chance. He probably said some nice things as well but I cannot remember if he did. Those bits stuck out. I could have got my money back for the year and that ordeal would have been the end of it. I would have given university a go and I would have walked out feeling alright about myself, a bit of regret but alright. I had an okay first term, the second I just hated. Long story short the people I was meant to be living with next year were all scumbags. I did not want to go back in the third term and made that very clear. My mom probably cared but it did not matter, in her eyes I was being an idiot who was going to throw away another crappy opportunity. She screamed, cried and eventually I thought it would be better if I just went. Low and behold they were assholes and I came back. The third time I went back before I went I told her everything and she still thought I should go back. I decided to give it one more shot and it was the worst decision of my life.

But its not like I hate dancing, I guess its the fact that I have to be active and that I have to interact with people when I have been trying so hard just to get away from them so my upcoming suicide will not bother them. Another reason is because of my mom. You might be thinking *woah, they sound like they are an annoying, entitled brat*. So let me explain. I have odd and relatively unhealthy eating habits. Its been like this forever. So when my mom suddenly starts asking me what I want to eat more and buys a bunch of food, I find it odd. she is never done this. And I have never thought too much about my eating habits so when she keeps bringing it up, it does not exactly feel nice. I do not know if I have an ED but my mom seems to see it that way.

       " 'Depression(majordepressivedisorder) is a common and serious medical illness that negatively affects how you feel, the way you think and how you act.I know that this is a very sensitive topic and I am very open for corrections, additional knowledge and ideas if ever.Before, I somehow associated depression with sadness. I mean, with the lack of knowledge, I used to think that sadness and depression are quite synonymous. But it is a big No No. Based on an article I read, sadness is defined as a normal human emotion. We as a human being tend to be \"sad\" \"disappointed\" \"downcast\" over a specific reason but eventually when we have already adjusted on the situation our sadness remits. While on the other hand, depression isanabnormalemotional state, a mental illness that affects our thinking, emotions, perceptions, and behaviors in pervasive and chronic ways. ( Unlike sadness, depression does not easily elapse until treated just like any other illnesses. What can we do to help people suffering depression?Convince them to seek medical help.Consulting a psychiatrist is not shameful. Consultations might be a little pricey but there are still foundations or psychiatrists who offers affordable or sometimes free consultation. Be a good listener. Rather than giving them random life advises it is better to just sit there and let them feel that you are always available to listen. Never force them to open up. And also, avoid using statements such as \"Cheer up\", \"forget about it\" \"It will pass\" and etc. because this will not help. Make them feel that you actually understand them. Again, the situation that they are in does not just \"pass\" or \"wear-off\", it is not a phase but an illness.Give them hope through God. Besides on their Mental health, they also might need spiritual help. Pray for them and let them know that we all have God at our back. Ask them to participate mass, worship sessions or bible groups.I am alarmed as some of my friends are actually experiencing it and I really have no idea on what to do or what to actually say, because I know that there is no amount of words that can actually ease the pain they are feeling. The best thing I can do, is to listen and make them feel that they still have that someone who actually cares for them when they feel that they do not matter anymore.To you, it is okay to feel that way. I know that things might be unbearable but never lose hope. Someone out there actually loves you so much. Please continue fighting. This world might be cruel at times but still remember the happy days and the people who actually makes the world lovable. there is hope.Better days are coming. let us claim it. Depression',\n",

I was the type to take college classes in high school so I could expedite the process. When I got the opportunity to move the USA at the age of 15, of course I said yes. Yes, dad! Of course I want to go. The land of opportunity, the land of the free. It has been more than 10 years, and I have been anything but free. I am 26 years old, and I have not started my career. I am an illegal immigrant. I cannot graduate, drive or work (unless I do so illegally, which has never been my desire; breaking the rules has always been my worst nightmare). Doing the wrong thing completely paralyzes me. I do not suppose dad knew what he was doing when he moved us to this country. And yes, I could have left, but it does not work like that in our family, where the man of the house is the ruler and tyrant. Leaving meant having nowhere to go with no roof over my head or food in my stomach. I have always struggled to make friends, I guess they all have sensed the brokenness that is in me and ran the other way. As the months go by, my interest in people diminishes. I want to be left alone. do not talk to me, do not look at me, do not breathe on me (please ignore all this and love me anyways). Just give up on me and leave (please fight for me). I understand I am hard to love, which makes this decision a little easier. Dad, even though you were tough on me, I know you were just as broken as me. I do not want to follow in your footsteps. I tried. I really tried. But I am you. Mom, I love you so much and I am sorry. You do not deserve to lose your only daughter, but I cannot do this anymore. Hubby. You have tried your best to be patient and be there for me. But my presence is a burden that you do not deserve to handle. I hope you find love again. I know you will with that light that shines through you. I have realized that a life in which I contribute nothing but pain and strife is not worth living.I hope it will be a light, painless death.

I feel like its a constant repition of one step forward two steps backwards and I just do not know what to do.If anyone reads this thankyou for hearing me out.

They just assumed that I did not want to help and told my supervisor which is bullshit. They think I am horrible because of a misunderstanding.

He did not want to hurt or burden me, so he tried to break up with me to isolate from everybody. I told him I will not let him be alone. I stayed and emotionally supported him, and he was happy I cared to stay.I did not realize that my daddy issues surfaced in the relationship. I needed healing for my inner child regarding insecurities and feelings of being worthy. When these needs were not met, I kept pushing him away, complaining, fighting, criticizing him.My bf tried to fix me, he felt guilty that he could not. He tried to heal me, lift my confidence up, he was like my therapist a lot of times. He tried so hard to make me happy by actions not words. I did not appreciate this. All my stupid mind wanted to hear was words from him because that was my mental issue I needed fixing. Nothing he did was enough for me, I desperately acted out every time he did not reassure me. I told the poor guy that he was hurting me and I could not take it. I blamed him that he did not do enough,and he was crushed. He loved me so much he stayed longer than he should have. He said he hung on by a thread for a while but could not take it. The past few months he felt guilty he hurt me. He also took a while to break up with me because he did not want to hurt me and break my heart. He said were not compatible, which I know is untrue because we would be perfect if I had worked on my issues, we are like best friends. He said I should find someone to love me right because he clearly failed. Now he is so stressed out with his job and his health, he is crumbling into pieces that he almost died. He broke up with me last week and told me to take some time to heal myself. I begged him not to break up for a while and he held on but now he begged me to let him go. He said hell still be here for me but as a friend and that he cares about me a lot. We are not talking right now. I feel tremendous guilt. He is at his lowest right now. I am going into therapy to fix my issues. How do I fix this ? I will clearly not try to win him back right now, but I want to be supporting him.

Diarrhea usually precedes the vomiting, and has a certain smell (smell only occurs in diarrhea RIGHT before I puke). Immediately after puking the nausea goes away until the next episode.

So my high school has 3 campuses, Main, North, and West. I went to the North campus and absolutely hated it, I was in a dual enrollment program where I earned an associates degree in cyber security which I have no interest in all because my parents pushed me to do it, since I am 1st generation. My parents were together at the time, but when they divorced while I was almost done with high school they stopped caring about what I did and it made/ makes me so angry that I stayed in that program for nothing! I am upset that they made the decision for me when in the end it was the least of their concern what I did with my life. So now I am stuck in this constant train of thought where I wonder if I had gone to the Main campus and done the cosmetology program how I wanted, if I would have made more friends, and potentially been in a few a dumb high school relationships. I wonder if I would have tried out for sports and been more extroverted. I think what also bothers me is that I see people from my middle school who went to the Main campus are still friends based on their social media posts, and I graduated alone in 2020 with no friends and a toxic household. How can I stop doing this?? I know I should stop being nosy on social media with my spy account, but its so hard because they were my friends in middle school at one point, so it bothers me a lot. Help?? I wish I could go back in time so so bad and fought my parents a little harder to take me out of the program since parent permission and signatures were required.

I managed to obtain my NCEA Lvl 1,2,3 even though I was kicked out of school due to being sevely bullied and having everyone hate me, I have had many fun sexual experiences, done some pretty crazy and one of a kind stuff, seen and done things alot of people could ever do etc. I always made sure to live every day as if it was my last and live fearless so I have lived my life on the edge and to the fullest although I was lonely and sad alot of it due to anxiety and past trauma. But things were starting to look up around last year I acquired a good job and a wonderful partner S.C. ironically I had my car accident 15mins after I dropped her off at a friend's place as she stayed at mine and we had only met in person the night before. But our relationship prospered and that crash made me become clean from alcohol and drugs because of the thought of her and prospect of career and family I have always wanted to raise children and live on a farm in the countryside etc. But... My life has changed for the worst now=Initially my illness started about 1am on Jan 18th 2021 after I awoke from a vivid nightmare drenched in sweat then I had an auditory hallucination and diahorrea and vertigo and derealization/confusion and brainfog and was shivering with chills but after I went back to sleep it went away within 1-day and in between time I went on holiday and suffered vertigo and ear pain on the car ride down and the initial sickness did not appear until Feb 9th I got the bad flu w/sore throat, vertigo, ear pain, coughing, running nose, chills, diahorrea etc. And on Feb 13th I then suffered derealization, severe brainfog, crying and sadness and anxiety, REM sleep issues like: falling sensation that jolts awake, flashing behind eyelids, hypnogogic hallucination, constant vivid nightmares every night, head pressure, diahorrea, excessive urination and short-term memory loss and a bunch of other stuff then around early March came a psychotic ocd presentation where I had this delusion I was developing shitzophrenia and had an intense fear of it and constantly Googled it then that sort of stopped and the derealization died down a bit and I was left with andeonia complete loss of emotions and then severe depression and mood swings the came these mini-stroke/seizures and severe brainfog that happened around start of last month and every time I had them I was getting memory-loss after long term and short-term almost dementia like memory loss then I developed an internal vibration. So currently of now my symptoms are: a slight brainfog, internal vibration, dementia memory-loss, vivid nightmares: still having hypnogogic hallucination upon waking, minor head pressure, crying and sadness/severe depression, and complete loss of emotional enjoyment in life, loss of track of time and what is going on around me, inability to retain information, loss of imagination, hair thinning, easily bruising, loss of libido, abdomen pain. So as of now I am 5.5 months into this illness and shts only getting worse I have had many blood tests, tried different diets, meds help with mood but none of the other symptoms, tried therapy, had 2 CT scans of head w/o Contrast tried heaps nothing works. I personally think it is maybe autoimmune encephalitis due to a virus, covid maybe? Not sure. So yeah I am pre much F'ed atm. Me and my girlfriend do long distance and she has stuck by me all through this, she flys up to where I live today as her family lives here and she comes up every school holidays I love her so much and she says she loves and supports me and will do till death and we are keeping each other alive as she struggles with her own issues too but I just feel useless and dead. An example is my nana she is in a dementia home and you look into her eyes and the life is just gone... No soul, just a lost mind trapped within a body that imprisons her that is how I feel atm and I do not want this to go on forever as I cannot feel life and emotions and feel severaly disconnected from everything and have impaired cognitive function as well as experiencing symptoms on the daily. I have always had a different insight on life I feel and have always thought and felt different from others idk why but I just have I feel special in this world and sometimes I wonder if it is just me alive and everyone else is figure of imagination idek haha. My plan is too spend my last 2-weeks with her and then if I feel no better or see no reason to continue then I will end it. Sorry for all the words and wall of text you prolly do not need my life story but I want to make sure my story is read by atleast someone before I go.As many of you know its a dog eat dog world and weakness is not tolerated and only the strongest survive unfortunately I am no longer strong and just a she will of a man really so yeah I was crying afraid of death and asking why this has happened to me for ages every night alone but I now realise maybe the good go first so we do not experience as much suffering as the bad who live on and generally die alone. The world is a strange place atm and is just full of pain, narcassism, suffering, corruption.

       " 'I have been very depressed for quite some time now. My daughter is autistic and I never feel like I am doing enough for her. I have been bullied all of my life and do not have any friends. I cannot date due to how my daughter is and because I only attract abusive men. I have gained a bunch of weight and my looks have gone down the drain. I am also just not very smart and I have never been talented at anything (even my own mom cannot come up witanything that I am good at, other than being a mom). I have been wallowing for a long time over these things and it is been exhausting.For the past week, though, I have been thinking about how the only one that matters is whether I am doing enough for my daughter or not. I have only been selfish by worrying about whether I have friends, romance, looks and talent. It finally dawned on me that my purpose in life is to love and care for my daughter and to only strive for things that will directly benefit her. This is actually helping me to become more focused on my goals, and I am actually looking into going back to school so that I can get a better job (purely to benefit her, not for my own enjoyment). I am also trying to be physically healthier, but this time it is so that I can be healthier for my daughter, not so that I can look attractive or for any other selfish reasons. Anytime I feel a bit down about any of these things, I redirect my thoughts away from myself and towards my daughter. I am finding that I am slowly but surely thinking about myself less and less, because I no longer matter to myself. I do find that I am a bit nervous to go back to school because, like I said earlier, I am not all that smart. Hopefully I can find a course that will work for me.Moral of my story is that the only thing that matters to me is my daughter and that I do not need any of those other things that apparently contribute to happiness. I have stopped caring about myself, and I actually feel a bit better for it.',\n",

       " 'So this all started about 6 months ago, my grandma had a stroke and was dying (we did not know if it would take a week maybe a few months we were not sure). So I decided to book a flight for me and my Fianc down to visit as I have not had the chance to visit in 6 years. The week of the flight all three of my vehicles broke down to where it would cost more to repair them than they were worth, that was not too bad, I had a little money saved up because my fianc and I were trying to save for a house. I figured I would dip into that and replace them when I get back, it was a bummer for sure though. I get down to Florida and my grandma does not even remember who I am which tore me up. I felt so bad because I had not been down to see her in awhile and by the time I did she could not hardly speak and her dreams were more reality than her grandson sitting in front of her. While I was down I figured I would visit my best friend of 15 years and we hung out for awhile and the next day I went to go spend time with my family. My fianc did not want to go so I left her at the house while I was visiting. Turns out my fianc was screwing my best friend while I was visiting my family. I only caught her because I woke up at 3am that night had a bad feeling and looked at her phone.I was devastated and that tore me up bad. I could not believe it. We were together 6 years and I never expected this out of my best friend or her. I was blindsided. Turns out when we gamed on Xbox together they had been chatting for awhile before this and took the opportunity to hook up while I was down to see my dying grandma. Went back home, I tried to mend things but when it was clear she did not want to I did my best to move on. At this point I am back home, sad I just lost my best friend, my fianc, and soon to lose my grandma, and still bummed about my vehicles I did not know what to do. I got super depressed, went drinking with some family, and then decided to do my best to use the pain to better my life. I read two 450 page self help books, I found a better career for myself that pays really well, I started working out and yet, everyday I think about my fianc. I wish I could stop and I hate it and no matter how much I improve my life I am still sad all the time. I just found out about a week ago my x fianc moved down to my x best friend and they got a place and are living together. It basically reset my depression, and then my grandma just passed and I am not sure what to think, feels like I am back at square one. Its been just over 6 months since all this happened to me and I am still broken from it. How long does it take people to heal? This has been pretty traumatic for me.

My anxiety is through the roof.\\n\\nCouple of years back I had stress-induced panic anxiety, with all the classic symptoms (rapid heartbeat, crazy tensions, panic attacks, fatique etc.). My doctor had a hard time telling me what was going on, and I kept coming to the worst conclusions -&gt; this gave me some crazy health anxiety and the fear of dying. I came over this in a year, and haven\\'t had any of this for 2 years straight.\\n\\nNow, 4 months ago I start to feel a little depressed, nothing major, I assumed it was due to the winter coming, messed up sleeping pattern and life just being a bit boring. This threw me right back into the health anxiety. Thoughts racing constantly about why I got depressed, what is happening to me, am I going crazy etc. I went to the doctor, saying that I felt off, a bit emotionally numb, and racing thoughts 24/7. I took a depression test there, but kinda showed nothing, so the doctor kept asking me questions about hallucinations and delusions, which I have had nothing of, never. I went back a couple of more times assuming something physical was wrong with me or atleast something crazy that messed with my cognitive abilities. Got the same questions again and again.\\n\\nSo I slowly started thinking about the questions, what if I am gonna hallucinate, see stuff that isnt there etc. Now I am stuck here with some 24/7 dp/dr, constant hyperawareness and crazy anxiety about hallucinating or going psychotic or something. It\\'s like my brain is in super defence mode, recognizing everything that changes in my surroundings, telling me to reality check everything so I am sure that I am not going crazy. I feel so off.\\n\\nI went to my doctor again and told her about the fear of going crazy or developing schizophrenia. And she sent me to a psyciatrist, with the reference of me being psychotic. When I read the reference I had a fullblown panic attack, I just froze. This made my anxiety 100x worse than before, thinking that I must be super crazy.\\n\\nRecently I went to the psyciatrist who asked me the same questions about delusions and halluciations, and I described again the same things. That I\\'ve never had them, never had any delusions. But I am starting to think whenever I see something, delusional thoughts pop up in my head, because of my obsession about the fear: \"what if I thought someone were actually following me\" etc.. all kinds of intruisive thoughts that I know for a fact that is no were near real, but just scary that that they pop up in my head all the damn time. I used some metaphors there at the interview and I think she might have gotten the totally wrong idea of what I told her. Because now I am being sent off to an interview about schizophrenia and psychosis, because she thinks I am that apparently, even though I don\\'t have any symptoms at all. She even gave me a temporary diagnosis as a schizophrenic wtf.\\n\\nThis is throwing me off, what the f is happening. Am I losing control, I can\\'t believe this is happening.

I’m always questioning my diagnosis because I feel like my mania isn’t even half as bad as some things I read. Or not even close to what is portrayed on tv shows or movies. Recently it’s been getting worse, as I’ve had strong urges to do really risky stuff. For example, I had such an urge to climb up the stairs and stand and lean over the railing where a kid jumped off. And I was gonna do it to get rid of the feeling, but then I was scared that I would continue to lean and lean until I got the urge to jump off. Same thing happened when I crossed a bridge except I did end up leaning into it. But before this episode, my mania was only feeling really confident, or believing I had superpowers, or paranoia that everyone was looking at me, and my irritation was really bad.

This morning, I now have a swollen lymph node where the pimple is.

I have been taking lexapro for three years, b/c previous therapists diagnosed anxiety disorder. So currently, i have a lot of mania, but very little depression. and the mania doesn't seem too extreme - my therapist thought it was BP 2 but the psych testing came back BP 1, which she agrees with now. I have thought I was the second coming on occasions, that's probably the most manic idea i've had. I have a good career, have always done well in the workplace. I am a mom and wife, and my family loves me. So I really hesitate to medicate. But I also wonder if I should keep taking Lexapro? My therapist said withdrawl from that is ugly, so she doesn't recommend it. But maybe it's been triggering my mania? I was also diagnosed with mixed personality disorder, mainly borderline with a heavy dose of narcissism. So naturally, I am very concerned with medication that could affect my skin (already went through struggles with acne while younger, not going to do that again) and also obsess about my weight. Anyone on a mood stabilizer that others haven't experienced acne or weight gain with? And no lithium for me, it's an unnecessary hit on my kidneys when I am pretty functional unmedicated.\",\n",

The ER doctor told me to stop the medication immediately and for the next 4 days I could hardly walk and needed a cane everywhere I wentSo. I feel pretty damn hopeless.

I do not think anyone ever will. How do you tell someone you are seeing that you are essentially emotionally numb, when they reach out to you and tell you they are in a bad place?

I am in a dark hole and just as I thought maybe I was getting out I have plunged deeper. I am thinking about antidepressants again, but I am scared last time I drank vodka on them and blacked out - but maybe they are my answer to these thoughts.

       " 'When I was around 10-13 years old, I was very social and made people like me. However, since I left my country at 13 y o I became an outcast. Since the first day of school, I was bullied and made fun of without the ability to defend myself because I did not speak the language of the country I went to. I was so excluded that I had to aimlessly walk in circles in the middle school\\'s playing ground because nobody wanted to talk to me. I felt so awkward. I even followed the other kids in hopes of them including me but I was completely ignored. I was like a ghost to them. Everybody seemed to have fun. It destroyed me to point of shattering my true self-esteem. I endured two years at that middle school then we moved out to another city. At that point, I craved human interaction, was at my ugliest, and started self-harming. Out of nowhere, a girl in my class sees my fresh self-harming scars and tells me that she did the same thing, trying to dissuade me from continuing that practice. We even started chatting on social media trying to ease each other\\'s pain. that is until I told her that I wanted to end it all and that I loved her. She threatened to call the police, which changed my mind. But that destroyed the bond that we developed and, like a dick, I started trying to guilt her into loving me. Things went south and long story short I became known as the depressed, self-harming, crying-in-school kid (teachers knew about the hit that I did). A status that I would not wish on my worst enemies. Fast forward to my first year of high school. I am still a shadow of my former self trying but I thought that I was reformed. Especially after befriending some friends. I acquired a gym membership and even willingly did a speech to my class, at the end of the year talking about how people change, how our class was perfect class accepting of everyone, and being a microcosm that could meticulously project our society. A microcosm where we can find the future: artists, doctors, architects, engineers, and more. Ending the speech with the confession of my love to a girl. Everything seemed going right. \"I am improving,\" I said to myself. Then year 2 comes. The whole year, my \"friends\" and I only talked in school. Rarely texting and we do it is for me being used as a tool for something. I spent all the holidays alone on my pc trying to lie on myself saying things like \"I do not need friends anyway\", \"I am happy\". Sometimes, I unveil my true feelings and start crying by the least trigger such as reading about how much people are having fun in their lives. I hate it when I see people happy. I hate god. I hate my life. I hate the wealthy who can do whatever the fuck they want (and do not fkn tell me how money does not buy happiness because a depressed wealthy person is \\\\*100 better than a poor depressed person) And I certainly would have driven a fkn spear to my heart if it was not for the fact that I am a coward and that my parents have already paid for my college preparation year.

Had been suffering from a long-lasting cough (5-6 weeks) and sought care. The doctor heard something on the left lung and sent me for an urgent x-ray the same day.  I was terrified and thought I had lung cancer.  I was nervous and scared to death until I got my test results back.  It showed nothing but I recovered a few days later.\\n\\n2021-09-14:\\nMy wife found a liver spot/mole on my back that looked weird. This after I had complained of itching in that place 1-2 months earlier. Thought it was skin cancer and was nervous and scared to death for several weeks before I received an answer that there was no danger. The mole didn\\'t look \"bad\" so they didn\\'t do anything about it.\\n\\n2021-10-07:\\nMy wife finds a lump on the right shoulder blade, size approx. 1x1 cm. It can be moved but feels strange somehow.  Immediately becomes completely convinced that this is also a cancerous tumor.  Either the skin cancer has spread or it is a sarcoma (soft tissue cancer that can feel exactly like a fatty lump). Once again, I became very nervous, stressed and scared to death. I sought care and was able to see a reputable doctor who informed me that it was a lipoma. When he was about to take it away, he says he can\\'t find it.  I imagined he saw it and it wasn\\'t a lipoma.  He said something to the other doctor and I didn\\'t really understand where.  He you catch me again and the lump is still there.  Instead, he sends me for an urgent MR X-ray and here I am completely destroyed.  I take him as if he has seen something that makes him not dare to cut me.  I lie at home and shake for several days and have such fear of death that it is completely sick. I end up trying to go into that X-ray tunnel but it doesn\\'t work. Tries 3-4 times but I just lie there and cry because I\\'m afraid of what the x-ray will show.  Here I am completely convinced that it is cancer of some kind.  I had to cancel everything and today the lump is still there.  The doctor called me 3 weeks later and said he was 100% sure it was a lipoma and that it can stay on my body without doing any harm. So, I still have it and I\\'m alive.\\n\\nDuring this course of \"diseases\" I get hemorrhoids and start having stomach problems.

I've been the odd one out since back when and slow on socialising - I can't seem to use social media well (too afraid that my relatives will find it) and/or hold conversations for very long even though I find people with the same interests. I've gotten responses that range from implying that I annoy them or getting told my way of thinking is... strange(?) I'm not sure how to phrase this since I tend to notice my ideas get shot down and nitpicked more than others in my friend group or even project team setting. \\n\\nI started withdrawing from my social circles as a result and getting used to living alone with myself. My family been supportive of me thus far and I shouldnt complain but I cant live like this for very long - I want to express myself and find a space for my art, craft and ideas that accepts me for me.\\nAnd I'm sure in order to be independent, I need to also be comfortable with myself.\\n\\nBut I'm not. I live life now never crossing the line with people even if I think its a terrible idea and is proven to be for the purpose of avoiding conflict, I withhold my ideas so as to not seem radical or stupid and avoid being berated or talked down. I feel like a NPC living a scripted life.\\n\\nHow do we overcome this and have the courage to live for us? Can I do it in a way to eliminate these stresses? Or is avoiding them the main issue?\",\n",

       " 'This is kind of just ganna be a thought dump I guess, but its something I need to put somewhere so it is not festering in my head.I do not really understand myself anymore. I have not in a really long time, I do not even remember a time where I could accurately describe how I am feeling. There are times when I am with friends or by myself and I do not necessarily feel happy but distracted and I like that. I have heard people say, \"I keep myself busy, I do not give myself the time to be sad\" but its just more complicated than that. It is not just sadness; its anger, self-hate, and a strange emptiness I cannot describe. Even when I am out with people, speaking with them, even when I am distracting myself with some type of work, there is just this sense of hollowness.I used to be the type of person that thought things would always work out. One way or another, they had to right? They do, until they just do not anymore. Nothing works the same, and realistically I know that is because of me. There are moments, just the briefest instants of motivation I have to force things to work out. To really put shit in place and buck the fuck up, ya know? And then it just disappears and I am just at such a loss. I do not remember when I first thought it, but sometimes things just do not work out. I realized something was not right a few years ago. I have thought about death since middle school, really considered it hard but I would snap out of those funks pretty easily back then. Up until I was 20, I figured I did not think about suicide anymore than the next guy or girl. Besides what did I have to complain about? There are people that are much worse off. I was working at a bingo place at the time and was just so mentally down. I had this little post-it note that I wrote a ton of things on, they were basically ways that I would off myself if I ever had the chance to. It was meant to be kind of like an angry letter, you write it and then throw it away. Some closure or dumb shit like that. Well my manager found it and we had a pretty awkward talk. She was kind of a hard ass, the type to just bug the hell out of you over really small thing, but there were times where she was really nice. That was one of those times. Anyway, I told her that there was nothing to worry about I was just \\'in a mood\\'. She did not tell anyone, thank fucking god, but its where I learned that thinking like that was not actually normal. I do not work there anymore, I quit not long after that. It was just too strange for me. I felt like there was always this strange look in her eye after that. I wonder if she would show up to my funeral. there is honestly a lot more I would like to share, but I do not want to make this any longer or stupid than it already is so I will wrap it up. I want to see a doctor, I need to see a doctor but they are so fucking expensive. I want medication, BUT I cannot GET IT. I do not want to feel like this anymore. I do not want to look up how I can die painlessly anymore. I do not want to debate how much longer I want to give myself anymore. I wish I lived in Sweden or somewhere that had euthanasia, that is not as scary as a gun and a rope. I want to fix my brain.I am sorry. I know stuff like this does not really help those that feel the same, but I needed to put it somewhere. I needed to exist beyond my house. I am not posting this for sympathy or pity, just for me and me alone. The same way people carve their names in trees. Although, this is much longer than a name. my brain',\n",

I’m 32 and I’m still on my adventure, as frustrating as that can be sometimes. \\n\\nIt was about ten years ago that I hear bipolar disorder is a progressive mental illness. I scoffed at it- I had been at the “same level” of mental illness from the start. \\n\\nThen all of a sudden, three years ago, all hell broke loose. I became insanely manic. I was hallucinating and ocd tendencies came out of nowhere. I was convinced that the planes that crashed into the 9/11 towers were going to crash into my home and the only way to stop them was to lock and unlock and lock my door again. \\n\\nAfter what felt like forever, that manic phase passed and I had the realization that I had hit a new level of my mental illness.

The lows are deeper, the suicidal thoughts have gotten more frequent (though I would never ever follow through- I love my kids too much). Everything thing feels so much BIGGER, if that makes sense. \\n\\nWhat was now something in the back of my head as a teenager, “Yeah I have bipolar disorder but I never even think about it, I’m too busy living my life. “ Has now become my biggest priority to keep in check and it’s almost all I think about.

I even felt shame and guilt of breaking things (because anything material has more value than me) .

       " 'How being outside reduces stress I will explain why being outside is good for your health. Nowadays we are often indoors almost all day because of school and work. There’s not always something wrong with that, but you’ll probably feel a lot better if you go outside every now and then.\\n\\n**IT MAKES THE MIND CLEARER**\\n\\nInside a house, study or workplace there are often many things that make you think about your work or study. There is nothing wrong with this, but it can ensure that you are constantly busy with your work or study. This may keep you thinking and living in your head instead of in the moment. In addition, there are all kinds of other distractions indoors that keep your mind from calming down. So go outside and enjoy the tranquility.\\n\\n**LESS STRESS**\\n\\nThis tranquility automatically reduces stress. You are not busy with school, your work, or other things. As a result, you go out of your head and into the moment. This will also reduce your stress and reduce the risk of stress symptoms and complaints. In addition, physical exercise is also a great way to reduce stress. When you are physically active you can reduce stress. You probably also feel that when you exercise. And after you exercise you notice that your stress is reduced compared to before you started exercising.\\n\\n[(Originally from this blog post)](https://quintenvanommen.com/why-being-outside-is-good-for-your-health/)',\n",
       " 'Why do negative social interactions give me such existential dread? How to cope? I’m posting here because I’m technically diagnosed as bipolar and I suspect it could potentially be related in the form of overthinking.\\n\\nOverall I’ve had pretty stable mental health since I graduated college and started working. College was hell and now I occasionally get hypomanic but nothing extreme. Even less frequently do I ever feel depressed. All without meds (has bad side effects, didn’t really help, felt like it kept me in a “sick” mindset but I digress). So I think I’m doing great overall. I feel privileged in that way.\\n\\nBut something I still struggle with is this feeling of existential dread I get when I mistake a mistake, am wrong, or am just being trolled.\\n\\nI have many examples, but one today was someone on an academic subreddit telling me I’m wrong about something and implied I’m an idiot that doesn’t know what I’m talking about. All when this person couldn’t refute what I was saying and was generally being a d*ck focused on me being wrong instead of trying to discuss as a community.\\n\\nOthers have been related to feeling secluded in my field of work because I research a type of illness our product exacerbates to find preventative measures. So sometimes I have to trigger people and if I try to find colleagues to talk to “it could harm the business” which my boss is annoyed about (not violating any NDAs)\\n\\nBut I digress.\\n\\nBasically, anytime I get shut down by someone one way or another, I have thoughts of just not wanting to continue on. Just being unable to cope with other people. \\n\\nI don’t perceive them as being s*icidal, like I wouldn’t act on it or plan or anything. But just a feeling of anxiety and fear from making social mistakes (like fearing being canceled for a misunderstanding). I just feel like I don’t know how to move on. Then I think my hypomania kicks that overthinking into overdrive.\\n\\nAll until I sleep and wake up the next day. Usually, but not always. Sometimes it does lead to dysthymia or depression.\\n\\nI’ve never really had a lot of friends. I’m married in a great relationship with great (international) in-laws but I don’t have regular friends I hang out with (mostly friendships of convenience, like classmates) nor do I have a good family. I guess I generally feel like I don’t really have people to support me.\\n\\nDespite being able to get by in most social situations fine, I don’t have a real social life and always feel lacking or like I know how to talk to people in personal. Like I only have enough social skills to survive and pass as normal but maybe awkward sometimes. But the awkwardness and not knowing what to do in social situations is what Sara me up',\n",

I was lying in bed today on YouTube when I came across a video of a girl doing some sort of dumb challenge. She was about 7 and I got a groinal response from the thumbnail. I clicked on the video to see if I was actually aroused by her. I did not think it was real arousal until I stood up and saw that my penis was half hard not a full erection though. I felt so worried about this and started doing more testing to test my attraction. I watched videos on YouTube of young kids in swimsuits to test my penis response to it. I did not get an erection and it actually got smaller so I was feeling relieved then when I put my pants back up they prushed off the top of my penis and i thought it felt good. I got even more anxious and that maybe I am actually attracted to kids but the anxiety I am feeling is stopping me from getting an erection. The thing I mentioned earlier would suggest so. After that I decided to test my attraction to adults so I went on the hub and got fully hard pretty quickly. I think this could have been a compulsion of mine to test my attraction to adults. I was just about to start beating when an intrusive thought popped into my head of a naked child. I felt like some pulse of blood to my dick and it freaked me the fuck out. I finished to a big breasted Woman but immediately felt like shit. I cannot stop thinking that the reason I fapped is because of the intrusive thought and I cannot tell if I liked it or not.

I do it all seamlessly, making it look effortless. I’ve never missed a day of work because I was tired or hungover, which is why I can’t stop acting the way I do. I don’t know how to say no.

The thoughts in my head won’t go away. I sit there in turmoil knowing that I am being unreasonable, but I am plagued by insecurity, fear of missing out, irritability, anxiety, and no matter how I try to reason through them, they disrupt my life. \\n\\nThere is such a stigma on not only bipolar disorder, but mental disorders in general that it has made me afraid to try medication.

       " 'Overcoming personal anxiety by helping others Long time HA sufferer and poster. I am fortunate enough to say I have managed my HA enough to a point where it’s not consistently affecting my life. Just want to share a few pearls. \\n\\nOur health anxiety is very self centered. We obsess over health , our bodies, etc. the key to recovery is to stop focusing on ourselves. More on this later. \\n\\nEverybody on here is a bit different. I personally feel a sense of relief with medical testing , doctor visits etc; but some are fearful of those things. For that reason this post may not apply to you. \\n\\nA lot of us are in the medical field. I myself am a dentist and have had the irony of dealing with hypochondriacs in my office who are worried about oral cancer. \\n\\nExamining a fearful patient the other day , and reassuring him that he does not have oral cancer, gave me an epiphany of sorts, which led me to the following. \\n\\nToday I joined the national bone marrow donation match website. It’s a wonderful opportunity to help out people that are going through what we all in this sub fear the most- terminal cancer. \\n\\nThink about it, you can save a life!Minimal procedure. A needle in your hip. Some painkillers and you are on your way. \\n\\nNot only that but there’s such a barrage of testing beforehand that you can all but be guaranteed that you don’t have any sort of underlying illness. (They only take 18-44 year old healthy donors for the most part ) all of the testing is free and meals and rides are covered. \\n\\nI don’t know if I’ll ever get called but the whole thing puts my personal health anxieties in perspective.  To save a child’s life from leukemia, for example, would forever change your life. \\n\\nI’m not saying you need to do this. But take the focus away from yourself. Whether it’s through charity, or through work, school, gym; I promise you will stop obsessing over your headache, leg twitch, or your heart flutter. I still have bad days but overall I can say I’ve improved a great deal from this philosophy.',\n",

I think I shouldn’t have seen those things, but it kind of stayed in my mind, and now I’m scared of eating anything that isn’t common for me. I would also see posts appearing on my social media about people suddenly developing allergies and it made me extra scared, even though I’m an adult with no allergies, and only one person in my family has it (my mom, shrimp). \\nIt’s kind of ironic because my favorite chocolate is snickers too.\\n\\nI know it’s not logical, but it’s hard to get it out of my mind.

Even writing this post requires a tremendous amount of effort. I have plenty of things to do, but I just have no desire or motivation to do anything. Going to the gym, working out, studying, learning a new skill, cooking and eating, it all just feels boring and dull to me. Some days I will force myself to go to the gym but I end up leaving because there is no energy/motivation to get through a workout. Nothing is enjoyable, besides video games and porn, but even those two things are getting really boring and do not provide me with the same amount of satisfaction any longer.I finally figured out that a large part of this problem stems from how lonely I am. I am 35 and I live with my parents. I left my job in the military because I could not take it anymore and wanted to earn my bachelors degree. I moved back in with my parents because of the pandemic, although I will return to school in the fall.

I have absolutely no friends. I looked for groups to join on [meetup.com]( but nothing really interests me. Besides, going to clubs like that just seems so strange to me. I have never had a girlfriend and never had sex. I am a good looking guy who is in great shape, but I think years of watching pornography online has really harmed/damaged my brain in some way. I have incredibly high expectations in women. I am trying to stop watching porn, but it is the only thing in my life that I enjoy and look forward to. That really hurt me to say that, but sadly it is true.The worst part about this entire situation is the amount of time I am wasting sitting here doing nothing all day. I have plenty of things I could be doing, but NOTHING interests me anymore. Everything is a chore and requires a tremendous amount of effort to do.I just want to feel productive again, but I am not sure what to do.

       " 'How bad does it have to be to be considered psychosis? I know I\\'ve had at least one episode of what was probably psychosis because I was diagnosed with stress induced psychosis when it was happening. I don\\'t know if that one was bipolar related or not, and I wasn\\'t treated with anything at the time because I was still quite young and the psychiatrist didn\\'t want to intervene with medication.\\n\\nHowever, I\\'ve had other symptoms since during what were probably undiagnosed manic or mixed episodes where I\\'ve started to believe things that were, retrospectively, pretty weird. Occasionally these beliefs also pop up when I\\'m very, very depressed. Sometimes I believe these things 100% unquestioningly, and other times I know they don\\'t make sense but worry about them excessively anyway. Sometimes it fluctuates between the two.\\n\\nA common one for me is worrying that other people can hear my thoughts, especially if I look at them directly. I also get concerns about people working against me or talking about me behind my back to try to ruin my life.\\n\\nAnother time I became convinced my childhood home was haunted and that a demon had followed me from there into my daily life. I kept seeing a figure in my room at night and I worried about speaking about him out loud in case he came for me. I still worry about this sometimes, and tbf I\\'m pretty sure that house really was haunted. My childhood friends and I talk about the weird slightly paranormal stuff that happened there so I\\'m not alone with that, but my sudden obsession with it was abnormal.\\n\\nI told a different psychiatrist about those two a while back and he said it was probably due to a combination of autism and trauma, and that it would likely go away with more EMDR. Since they kind of just left as my mood changed, he was satisfied that his therapy had worked.\\n\\nI had another one where I decided I was actually naturally nocturnal and that other people were interfering with that to purposefully make me sick and stop my plans. I completely flipped my sleep schedule for several weeks (although admittedly I wasn\\'t sleeping very much anyway), and then fought with all my family and friends about it.\\n\\nAt one point I also became very worried that other dog walkers were all talking about me on Facebook and were plotting to take my dog away. \\n\\nAnother time I was certain I was dying of some horrible illness and all the medical professionals I saw weren\\'t treating me on purpose because they wanted me to die. (I really was sick though, but the level of paranoia was weird).\\n\\nI was still somewhat functional while all of these were happening, and I wasn\\'t hearing voices or anything for the most part. So does it really count as anything serious? Because it didn\\'t seem that bad to me, and my family just kind of ignored it since they\\'d been told that the episodes were stress related and it was best not to engage. I\\'ve never told a psychiatrist about all of the thoughts because I didn\\'t view them as relevant; until recently, I just thought they were a part of life and it was something I did when I got stressed.\\n\\nTLDR; at what point does it cross the line into actual psychosis vs \"being paranoid and having weird thoughts\"?\\n\\nI\\'m going to be starting medication for the first time soon if all goes well. My current psychiatrist is talking about putting me on antipsychotics, but idk if these episodes are really bad enough to warrant taking an antipsychotic. I\\'ve been reading about the drugs and they sound like heavy duty stuff, and I can\\'t tell if, for me, it\\'s really necessary. I think I\\'d rather try another type of mood stabilising medication first. I don\\'t know how I feel about all of this.',\n",

       " \"Chicken or the egg? discussion! Hi everyone! \\n\\nI have a question that has been occupying my mind for a long time, and I hope that this will spark a discussion and we can get deeper into understanding bipolar and find some answers. Maybe some of you are wondering the same.\\n\\nThe question: mostly during manic episodes when my mind is racing at an alarming pace I wonder if this is all caused after all by external factors that make me stressed out OR by the bipolar itself, so from within. Like, I'm starting to stress out because a situation occurs that is out of my control: turmoil in a relationship, some annoying interactions, things at work etc. Or I start stressing out because of a shift towards manic?\\n\\n This is where I'm lost: at times I think that because of the diagnosis I overthink the stress and anxious feelings; knowing and convinced about my diagnosis i fully inserted bipolar behavior into my own identity and it informs my actions? But we don't live in a sterile bubble, life is life and always something is happening.\\n\\n\\nFor context: \\nduring my manic state I start pacing, mind racing, increaced heart rate, twitches and intrusive thoughts. I start walking fast through streets almost running away from this, and I end up looking into passerbys eyes and then it's as if I'm being thrown into their lives, as if I live through their experience, I imagine how they act, what happened in their childhood, flashes into their daily routine, interactions, frustrations and happiness. And then I look at a window on some far away building, start imagining and experiencing the life of another person in a similar way.\\n Then I get thrown back into my body into reality and become more overwhelmed. Then it's my own memories of the past, then imagining my own future and so on. \\n\\n \\nThe experience is intense and doesn't stop. When it wears off eventually I regain focus, calm and ability to think clearer. Happens periodically about every few months and lasts usually about a week, maybe 2(depending how I deal with it after the peak. It's not the most intense that happened but I don't wanna go in even more details, because this is already TL;DR \\n\\nEdit: I have been diagnosed by 4different doctors on 4 separate occasions, and rejected that idea for about 7 years until it became too unbearable and I was legit worried that this time I'm definitely not making it through. \\n\\n\\nSo let's discuss the initial question! Would love to hear your thoughts about this chicken or the egg question and gain some insights!\",\n",

       " \"Recently I have started this internship and moved to this really amazing city, an opportunity I have been waiting for one and a half year but unfortunately for me, I absolutely hate the work that I have to do. Ironically from a general point of view it is really not awful and while I am fully aware of it, it still everyday kills me a little more. However this internship was my way-out ticket from last year which was one of the worst years of my life. we have got sent home from uni, my 3rd and last study year became online and I do not think I have ever encountered so much loneliness, isolation and dullness like I did during the pandemic in my life. Besides work and work again though on my 2 days off I either read or stay in my hotel room. Have got absolutely no one to do anything with. Go out, hang-out, eat or explore the city and doing all these things by myself just makes me feel even more alone than I am so it seems like that is it. that is where my life stops. And I am stuck. Because even though I feel like I cannot stay here any much longer I know for sure I can not go back home. Because as little as I have here, I literally do not have anything back home. No friends, no group, no social life absolutely nothing. And that makes me feel like I am completely missing out on life, at 23 when I should be living my best years, gain all these experiences and feel young, I feel old and tired and absolutely broken inside. I just can not fathom why seemingly I can not have a more active life. what is painful is that I am someone to who being active and friendships count a lot and yet no matter what I try or where I end up, it is always the same pathetic record - me being so on my own and never having friends ever since I have graduated high-school. I honestly just do not know what to do anymore. Where to go or what to follow but this can not be it. it is exhausting feeling and living this way. Doing and having nothing and holding back crying almost every day. A huge part of why I am so unhappy that is probably even more excruciating is the fact that I am not able to do what I am really passionate about professionally. The school I ended up going to was a plan B. I have chosen it after already dropping out of another one and deep down even though I was hopeful I have knew I would probably end up here. that is the thing about plan B's is not it? I think that is exactly the reason why I am so lost and cannot seem to find my place in this world. I have tried so many different things and they all were such a clear reminder that I know I am on the wrong path and that my biggest issue starts from there. I have grown up with an immense love and fascination for film and I do not think there is anything that I would want to do more than film-making. Unfortunately in my home-country there is no school or even an industry for that and abroad I just simply can not afford to study. it is literally the only thing I know in my bones I would be good at. it is hard to explain but I just feel it. What I am having a hard time with is understanding why is that my so-called professional call if that is literally the only thing I would want to do, but cannot. It consumes me how much I would want to at least be able to try to do something about it but cannot. And accepting whatever's left instead just kills me and clearly even though I have tried and am still trying even these days is not a healthy option. Lastly I just want to quickly mention that for some reason even though I love reading, books make me feel even worse. I have been reading a lot of YA and they all depict a reality I would like to find myself in. All the laughs, all the friends, all the parties and crushes are exactly the elements I am missing and have always been missing from my life. And this is exactly why I feel like I do not belong. I feel things differently. Maybe I just feel more. People nowadays are so shallow and to me valuing things, being genuine and having genuine connections is still so important. I have got so much life in me and things I would want to do, places I would want to visit but here I am. Maybe I am just delusional, maybe I have high-functioning depression, I have been thinking about therapy a lot but I just know that it is not going to magically give me neither friends nor the career and life I would like to have. I just feel like I am not right for this world, I honestly do and even though I am not suicidal and I would never do anything to harm myself death seems like such an easy way out. As if tomorrow I would be told I have a terminal disease it would give me a twisted purpose because for the first time in my life I would know where everything is headed to. This one and a half year for some reason I can not begin to tell you how much I have thought of that. Anyhow, thank you a lot for taking time to read this if you got to this point any advice is much appreciated! I think I am never actually going to have a life or find my place in this world\",\n",

I could be selfish and quit on family and throw my life into helping any one of hundreds of suffering communities. Fuck I could set out to end the war on drugs by becoming the biggest drug supplier in the world and then destroying the organization from within.

       " 'Wondering if I was misdiagnosed— no, I’m not taking myself off of my meds. I’ve been struggling a bit recently. 33F, diagnosed bipolar (type unspecified) 4 years ago.\\n\\nI have a clear history of depression going back to high school that I don’t dispute. I was diagnosed ADHD as an elementary schooler and again in high school (good student but disruptive in class, incessant talker, impulse control issues, highly unmotivated unless I’m interested in the subject, object permanence issues that persist today), medicated for it on and off, was prescribed a variety of medications and responded best to Adderall, but I also have a touch of anxiety so dosing was finicky. Treating the ADHD diagnosis yielded some progress, but never addressed all of my issues. I was medicated for depression at various times with similar results, but notably* was never treated for both diagnoses at the same time. (Edited a typo.)\\n\\nFour years ago I was unmedicated and my depression was the worst it had ever been. I started seeing a new psychiatrist, pried a bit into my family medical history (both ADHD and bipolar appear), and got a bipolar diagnosis. I’ve been on Trileptal and Wellbutrin since then, and like before, I feel a little better than I did before the meds, but the issues aren’t addressed. My symptoms are mixed, and I feel some degree of symptomatic (obviously good days and bad ones) every single day. My manic symptoms consistently spike in conjunction with anxiety flare ups, which are always traceable to a trigger.\\n\\nMy sister (28F) is diagnosed with depression and ADHD and, when she describes how the combination affects her, it matches up to my constant mixed symptoms to a T. I’ve started to wonder if I haven’t been going at my mental health the wrong way, and I’m extremely anxious about bringing it up to my doctor for fear of sounding manic. I don’t think that I’m healed or no longer in need of meds, and I don’t plan on taking myself off of them. I also don’t plan on asking for stimulants; I’m open to any treatment plan deemed a fit. But I have a lot of concern that I won’t be taken seriously.\\n\\nHas anyone been through anything like this? To be clear, I’m not asking for commentary on a diagnosis! Just seeking advice for broaching this subject with my doctor. Part of me wonders if I might be best off trying to connect with a new one; I’ve raised concerns about my meds not being effective numerous times in the past and haven’t really felt heard. But then I worry about the appearance of doctor shopping, and again, I’m not actively seeking stimulants. Anyway, any wisdom would be appreciated!',\n",

       " \"I am at a breaking point with my life. Genuinely I do not want to do this anymore. If anyone is willing to read this and just respond I would appreciate it. I feel so alone.I had a super rough childhood and never learned to self soothe, ended up with BPD OCD and CPTSD. My dad is a meth addict and my mom only started to really understand her own emotions whenever I was 16, before that because of her trauma she had no idea how to handle emotionally kids and would be super mentally abusive.I had my first kid whenever I was 17, and then twins whenever I was 19. Both of the dads were very abusive, cheated on me frequently and I did not understand leaving a relationship and grieving through it, so I just ended up staying and now have severe self esteem problems. I attempted suicide several times before I was 20, but obviously failed. And for a long time I was grateful that I lived. I also ended up with addictive issues pretty early on, around 12 I started self harming and at 15 started drinking heavily that quickly turned into meth by 19 and heroin by 23. I lost my kids to cps when I was 21, and could not get sober before losing the case and my aunt and uncle adopting them whenever I was 22. This was in 2017. My aunt and uncle are extremely religious and verbally abusive. My cousin came out as gay and all my kids get to see is them disowning him and telling him he is going to hell and that gay people are bringing on the rapture.I have only seen my kids two times in the past two years, and each time is re traumatizing for me. I will always take any chance I have to see them, and spend all of the time I can with them while I do. But leaving them causes me to spiral for months after. I do get tk FaceTime with them once a month if my aunt and uncle let me.I have been off of meth and heroin for 3 and a half years now. I stayed completely sober for the better part of a year, I did still smoke weed but that did not affect other parts of my life, and was actually helping me with my mental illnesses.I began a relationship with my current partner right around 8 months into my sobriety. I ignored every red flag and felt as if I could just micro manage my way into a good relationship. Thanks BPD. This relationship has been super toxic and damaging to my mental health, but I cannot make myself leave. I do not have a fear of being single, I actually fantasize and crave being alone and working on myself. But everytime I try to leave him I end up changing my mind and 'working on things'. He is emotionally unavailable and in a lot of ways gaslight the living hell out of me.I started using pain killers with him as well, but once he started having tremors he stopped and I kept using them. He has no idea that I have this issue, but whenever my emotions get too big it shuts them down. Or when I feel alone or hurt or like I want to die. Tbh using them has also kept me from making any real changes with my life and has only aided in me adapting to my current situation.I have been trying to work with a therapist but everytime is ee her all I can talk about is how shitty my partner is being. I cannot focus on making any real change and my therapist pretty much can only tell me what I already know (being gaslit and being with someone who is on a different level than I am emotionally) and tell me the only way to love forward is to leave him. I agree with her, but for some reason I cannot do it.I feel like I am stuck, I cannot make any decisions I cannot change any part of my life all because something is me switches (I think it is called splitting). So whenever I try to break up with him or change jobs or whatever else I split and my entire thoughts around it changeI do not want to do this anymore. I do not want to figure out my emotions. I do not want to feel anymore. I spend the majority of my time trying so hard to figure out why he hates me so much or regretting my life choices that ended up with my kids being in this awful situation or trying to fight off images of killing myself. My ocd has gotten so unreal recently and it is impacted Mt day to day life.I do not know what to do or where to turn to for support. Literally no one I talk to understands what I am going through on any deep level. I feel so unbelievably alone. I have bene trying to find codependency meetings in my area but there are not any.I do not know what to do. I want advice on steps to take that I can wrap my head around. But that does not seem real, or seems like an excuse in my mind to ignore the obvious.I KNOW leaving him would benefit me tremendously and that I could start to heal from there, but my brain literally will not let me. We live together and work together and own a car we are paying off together.I want to die, but I am coming here as a last ditch effort to be heard and maybe hear from someone who has an understanding or any advice.I am so sorry for formatting and length and totally understand if the read is too long.

Just yesterday I thought of just forgetting all of this and so I just stepped out of the house, there was a road I had to cross and I do not exactly understand what happened, all I remember was there was some thought on my mind and I just stood there thinking about it, in the middle of the road. Fortunately, the driver was driving slow and just honked on me snapping me out of it. I used to love doing stuff, coding, writing, reading and even sometimes focus on my academics but now, it is like everything has lost it is taste, it is like I do not recognize myself anymore like as if it is not the 'me' anymore.

I must say for myself it has been helpful with the depression but its certainly not a fix all for me. So with that I wanted to share some tips of what I have encountered along the way with trying to afford and stay on this medication. There are some options or relief available. Not sure I'd call them solutions but instead kind of band-aids. Ultimately it wont get better until generics come out but from what I have read it doesn't look like the patent will run out till like 2026 or thereabouts.\\n\\n\\n\\n1. When you get the script from the doc make sure to ask about samples if they are not provided first off. I got lucky and I have to say I was on this med for probably a good 3 months just on samples alone. Perhaps my practice is a bit more forgiving on that front.  I told them I had problems with getting the cost (which I did) so they gave me more samples to hold me over till payday.  There were also times I ran out before the pharmacy could get an order in, and in which case they gave me samples to hold me over till I could get filled.\\n\\n\\n2. Get the discount card!!! It says pay as little as $15 which for me brought my cost down to $150. Not great but far less than what it was. [Latuda copay Assistant](https://secure.latuda.com/secure/latuda-savings.cfm)\\n\\n\\n3.  Check if you have a preauthorization requirement for this drug. Unfortunately this might require you to call your insurance company directly. Some pharmacies might be able to tell you if its required. For me if my pdoc didnt submit a preauthorization the cost for me was near retail which is about $1300/US.\\n\\n\\n4.  Check if you have a prescription deductible. I did and at the beginning of every year it renews. So I was surprised to find that my drug I was getting for $150 was now ringing up at $400. Sadly the only way past this is to pay it. But once paid, my cost was back down.\\n\\n\\n5. McKesson the company that provides the discount card will also provide you with two 14day supplies of latuda at no cost.  That is right, **FREE**.  Just today I got my second free 14day supply of latuda. Call them up at 1-855-5-LATUDA and you can speak to a rep to get this. They will provide you with the info that is used the same as another discount card.\\n\\n\\n6.  Lastly I was told of another option they have available where they will supposedly try to negotiate a lower cost with the insurance company. I'm not sure what kind of success rate there is with this as I have not yet attempted to go this route. This will be my last ditch effort before telling doc its too much and have to find something else. In order to do this you would call the same number above 1-855-5-LATUDA and inquire talk to someone about what options are available and perhaps inquire specifically about negotiating how much the insurance cost/pay.  I only found out about this one as my insurance is always rejected with the card so I called the card company to sort it out and was somehow transferred to a rep that informed me this is what her department did, before transferring me to another.  \\n\\n\\nAnwyays, hope this helps some of you. The preauthorization and deductible points should apply to all medications and is something to consider. Its possible that the other solutions might work with other medications as well if they are cost prohibitive. \\n\\n\\nEdit:  Looks like the patent does expire on July 2 2018. So perhaps there is hope for a generic sooner than later.\",\n",

       " 'I do not know how to express my thoughts and feelings without feeling like an idiot, I have programmed myself to never feel externally as a means of survival, I have a solid exterior but inside I am torn to pieces.During my childhood, I constantly moved around, going to different schools, cities, I was never able to settle because my mother is a hardcore alcoholic, running from any responsibility.I used to come back from primary school and walk in on my mother passed out. I used to sit and entertain myself for hours in a silent, life less home.I used to worry about bills, electricity and food before I would even hit my teenage years. I had to walk my mother to the shop, whilst she leant her entire weight upon my shoulder, we would stagger there, day or night just so she could get her drink.When I went to school, I could not relate to the other kids, I could not laugh with them, I did not watch the same programs or like the same things, I did not have any siblings, a father, I had no guidance.During my teens, I used to jump into relationships with girls, but I was never stable enough to hold it down. I would go to school and fight the other kids, distract them in class. I was full of anger and resentment. I did not feel understood, my teachers called me names, made an example out of what not to be. I was the disruptive naughty kid. I was given detentions, put on report, constantly punished.I would come home to the same cycle, my mother passed out, or mentally checked out. Her pupils would change when she was drunk, I would know my mother was gone.Now I am 22 years old, still living with my mother, stuck in a shit hole city. I somehow managed to get a degree, determined to fight against the hand I would been dealt.I have been through waves of acceptance, anger, depression. It never truly goes away.My mother stopped drinking, supposedly found spirituality and detached from her ego. I thought she was healing, I was so proud of her and for once my home started to feel safe...I told her I think I aced a job interview today.. She started telling me all of the negatives. \"The areas not safe, people there will hurt you.\" \"You will not like it it will be boring.\" \"you are bad at maths, you will not be able to do it.\"I have a solid exterior, I am a fully grown man now, I am tall, broad, the one thing my father gave me was good genes. I am capable, I am strong, intelligent. I have held down jobs in the past, I was a manager before I went to university.Tonight I ask her to not be so negative, I ask her why she cannot just be happy and support me for trying to better my life.. she tells me that she has done her 18 years of service to me. She says I am holding onto the energy of the past, that it is time to move on.. She tells me I should leave the house if I hate her so much.. She tells me I am selfish, a narc, that I hold her past I have her head out of spite..I am sitting here feeling pain, I feel alone, there is nobody in this world who truly has my back but me, there is nobody to pull me out of the gutter when I am in need.. There is nobody there who will truly help me..I feel so jealous of people who were raised in a loving environment. I watch people I went to school with living life, driving, living independently.. Here I am, barely able to make enough to pay off my debts, let alone save enough to leave.. The rent in my city is insane.I tried supported housing for 6 months, but living around a house full of people with hardcore drug issues made me feel like I was still at home.. People trying to come into my room.. Dirt and grime everywhere outside of my door.. Shit on the sink in the shared bathroom..Everything is so hard. I am struggling to keep fighting. I cannot tell anyone how I feel in real life, I am supposed to be this big, impenetrable guy who people can rely on..When I try to speak to people, nobody takes. It seriously.How much more can I take? When will life cut me a break? I just want to be happy, I just want to be independent, away from damaged, crazy people.. 22M - Narc alcoholic parent',\n",

Of course my father has his own issues, but it is so much better dealing with his narcissism than my mom and her bf's abuse.

I tried to have a retail job before but felt extremely overwhelmed from my anxiety that I quit and wanted to focus on college.My mom knew I cut myself in high school, and she just laughed at me and asked why and did not care at all. She also knew I starved myself everyday as well. She constantly tells me others have it worse and I am overdramatic, so I could not get help if I wanted to. Hell, when I was 10 she told me to kill myself which I put a plastic bag over my head and tried to do as she said. And at the time we lived with her step mom who complained about the noise and beat me with wood spoon for crying during that whole ordeal. When I say no one would care, I honestly mean that. I am just done. At the end of July when I have to move, I hope my plan of killing myself succeeds.

When I got to my young teens I was still as curious, but I started to realise how fucked up the world was. Id also fucked up by developing autogynephilia, which is arousal to the thought of being a woman. Its all I ever masturbated to. This led me to developing gender dysphoria, but not enough to want to transition. I still have the thought in my mind but Id never go through with it.I have only ever been truly in love with one girl, and since I have finished school for good about a month ago (I am 16) she is now dating my old best friend. Small world, I guess. I am scared of sex and intimacy in general, but I have actually seen them together in public or on social media together and it just makes me so *numb* and jealous because I think that should be me with her and not him. I have never liked someone like her. And of course now I have dysphoria it hurts even more for reason. Just my luck.Back to the dysphoria, its made me have thoughts of suicide for the first time in my life which really scared me. I just want to be like every other boy without getting this voice in my head telling me its not right. I have stopped working out and am avoiding masculine things in general, I even get dysphoria looking at my own dick. Literally 3 MONTHS AGO I LIKED IT.

I have just applied for my first job in a bar but I am so anxious to fill out the forms. I am 3 days late to do it.

Christmas night, I suffered a panic attack out of the blue...and somewhere around that time (I can’t recall exactly when) I must have googled that symptom (severe acid reflux) and ended up at the conclusion that I have stomach cancer or pancreatic cancer. I have rather honed in on pancreatic. In the weeks following this, I have completely lost my appetite. I’ve dropped about 10-15 pounds.   I have horrible dry mouth, pains in my abdomen and back, sporadic diarrhea (when I actually can eat anything) I cannot work, be a mother, or give my attention to anything that isn’t focused on my impending demise. I have obsessively written down my theories about what I think I have, my symptoms and what’s causing them. I feel as if I can feel the cancer in my body. I’ve even researched how to tell my child that I have cancer bc I want to be prepared. I endlessly google and search YouTube videos.

       " 'When I was 11 I was diagnosed with depression and generalised anxiety. As I got older my symptoms grew worse as I suffered under numerous traumas. Bereavement of a parent via murder. Emotional abuse by the other parent. Neglect. Rape, seeing someone die right in front of me, and being abandoned aged 15.I was highly traumatised by these events and was diagnosed with other mental disorders including complex PTSD. I went to a small school for children with mental and behavioural difficulties. Until I started college at 16, I had no education beyond primary school age. So I was 11yrs old when I stopped being educated.I was still put through for Maths and English GCSEs despite the lack of education. I got a C in English and an F in maths. I still do not know why the fuck I thought to do a mixed construction and engineering course at college just months after failing maths The sad truth was, I was only picked to do that course because I was 1 of 4 women out of over a 100 boys in that department. Nobody else in my class had below a D in maths, most had A-Cs.I did maths in my first year alongside my Level 2 course and failed. In my second year (my now level 3 course) with the help of a very kind teacher I managed to get a C in maths.During my actual course I struggled very hard. 4 non practical exams and a few practical ones. I was weak and I would never even held a drill in my life, but I tried so hard to learn. I would cry before and after my practical day, which was a Tuesday. My teachers did not know my full background obviously, but I was severely scarred all over my body from obvious self harm and my uncle was my next of kin, so it was obvious I had not had it easy. I would come in 2hrs early and I spent the summers working in the workshop to learn more. I barely passed in my first year. In my second year I did well. In my 3rd year I was in the top 3 of my class.In my second and third year I volunteered at a local charity shop every Saturday. I was helping with general stocking shelves and talking to customers, but I was contributing to helping this private charity taking care of abused dogs. I felt confident enough to study a particular niche type of engineering, it was a university course.I dropped out within 2 months because I could not cope. Different teachers, much harder work, different classemates. And the development of a very painful chronic pain condition.My life spiralled. I was running out of money and was too ashamed to go onto benefits, so I attempted suicide.I went onto benefits eventually. I was finally diagnosed after months of going to the drs with pain and being told to just take ibuprofen. Eventually after moving to a different GP surgery I was referred to a specialist and given painkillers. it is been 3 years. I am on PIP and universal credit. it is took 3years of being under a psychiatrist and being given all kinds of antidepressants and an antipsychotic to actually be told I need therapy. Took 3years of begging before they referred me to a psychology service. I am starting EMDR next week. I am waiting for treatment after waiting years for the pain clinic to suggest a course of action.Yet I hate it. I judge myself and those around me judge me. I am a burden on society. I have never worked an actual job. My anxiety that I spent years working on is so bad I sometimes cannot even leave the house. My self harm started after I stopped for years. I am on so many medications that many drs have expressed concern. I am diabetic, which they think is related to my untreated PCOS and that I spent years on a particular antipsychotic that can because it. I still do not know what type I am. I do not even care anymore. I pay (pre payment card) for my mountain of prescriptions because I feel too guilty and ashamed to tick the universal credit option.I hate how my life has turned out. And I am too sick, too anxious, too depressed and traumatised to change anything I am 23 and a burden to society',\n",

The only way I can explain the sensation is that it felt like someone was grabbing my heart and squeezing. \\n\\nA couple of days later I went to my doctor and had all the necessary tests. Blood work, EKG, echo etc. All results came back fine, as expected, except for the fact that I have an oddly low pulse (53 most of the time) and the chest tightness remained. \\n\\nOver the next few months my panic attacks became less frequent (twice a week) and my chest tightness began to disappear.\\n\\nI managed this by reminding myself throughout the day of any moment where I was distracted enough to feel normal. An hour or two went by and I would be suddenly be reminded that I’m not dying. I feel great. It must all be in my head. \\n\\nI had also started weekly therapy during this time but I didn’t find it particularly helpful. My therapist mostly talked for an hour and guided me through breathing exercises. I think what I really wanted was to find the route of the problem.\\n\\nMore recently, my panic attacks have been worse and more frequent. \\nI have been feeling heart palpitations a lot, or more accurately, my heart skipping beats.\\nI began checking my pulse and counting the beats fairly often at this point, causing more anxiety and more panic attacks. \\n\\nNow I’m obsessed with my low pulse and my blood pressure machine. Almost all results show high blood pressure with a pulse of 51.\\n \\nI have just had a heart monitor on my chest for 48 hours and won’t get the results back for another 10 days or so. \\n\\nAnd this is where I am at…\\nFrequent panic attacks and the constant thought that my high blood pressure and low pulse will either kill me, give me a stroke or make me faint.\\n\\nAnyone else gone through this? \\n\\nThanks!',\n",

       " 'ThrowawayIm female, 20 years old. Ever since I was 12 I have been on antidepressants, antipsychotics for severe depression and anxiety. My parents are divorced since I was 2. they have both been in relationships after. I have lived with my mother and majority of my life its just been us two living together. My brother lived with my father. My mother was in a relationship when I was 11. We moved in with him. He abused her mentally and physically. I heard everything. I saw the scars. Fast forward a few years later she dated another guy. I had met this guy before, we lived with him when I was around 7. It did not last. Last year we got a call that he had hung himself. My father does not understand mental illness. He often calls me a baby or a child and tells me to just suck it up. That its all in my head. My one and only serious relationship was with a boy online. It started when I was 14. Went on and off since I was 17. He said he would come to Canada and marry me. We would have an amazing life together and have kids of our own. I was so happy. Everyone around me told me he was mentally abusing me. I did not see it. But he would not let me have friends, he would get insanely jealous. I was not even allowed to go over to my female friends house, and when I did, he would get super angry. He controlled everything in my life. Got upset when I went to school and did not stay home to talk to him. Eventually he left me for one of my other friends online. I begged him to stay, I had never felt so broken. He did not. he would say awful things about me. The anxiety and depression got so bad I could not go to school. By this time, I was in grade 12. Every time I walked in the school, I had a panic attack. could not be around people. I tried online school, I could not do it. It was too difficult without a teacher. I still have not graduated. I have never had a job- its hard to leave my house. I cannot drive. I cannot cook. I cannot do anything by myself, my mother raised me to be super dependant. 3 years ago she started dating a guy (now fiance) she previously was best friends with. He was around me a lot when I was a child. I do not remember much. The meds make me forget most of my life including my school years. First couple years were fine. I eventually got really sick. Last year I developed severe ocd. Contamination ocd. I cannot touch anything he has touched. cannot have him in my apartment. My mother gets angry and blames me that she cannot be happy. I have tried 3 different meds since then, all the free therapists the government gives me. Nothing helps. They say I developed ocd as I most likely have psychological issues with men because of all the wrong they have caused me in my life. My family all acknowledges I need professional psychological help. They do not have the money for it. My mom is on permanent medical assistance as she has severe stage 4 endometriosis. My dad lives with his girlfriend who has kids, they cannot afford me or take me in either. My grandparents just want to live a chill retired life. They do not want me. My brother lives in a different province. This takes me to why I need to get out of here, though I have no place to go. Last night my mom got upset with me and said she wants her life back. she is sick of my mental illnesses and says she is going to have her fianc over. She acts like she forgets that I nearly starved to death last year, literally days away from starving, because I was too scared that what she cooked was contaminated because she was around him. The ambulance was called at my therapists office because he saw that I could barely stand up. I was shaking really bad. I was extremely malnourished. I was not able to shower for the same fear that she contaminated the shower. Again last year my mother called the police on me because I said I did not want to live anymore after she had threatened our relationship if he does not come over. She said that she would not watch movies with me anymore or be around or spend time with me at all (which really affected me because she was like my only friend. do not have barely any irl bc of my anxiety to leave the house and she knows this). Everyone I do talk to says that she emotionally abuses me so bad. I have a video of her saying that our relationship is nothing now anyways. This week she said she was going to lock me out of the fridge for getting a piece of balongne. She said that I have gluten on my hands (she has celiac) even though I did not even touch anything with gluten, and she said that I am probably the reason why she is been sick this past year. She wants to move in with her fianc, and I am the one holding her back. She always makes sure to let me know that I am the reason why she cannot have happiness in her life. She makes me feel like I am just a roadblock. And so much more. So when the police were called they came into our small apartment - 4 men. They forced the blood pressure machine on me even though I was crying telling them its contaminated. They told me to grow up and act like an adult. They told me that since they have been called twice now, that next time they are called they can put me in handcuffs and arrest me. It traumatized me so much. The self harm last year was out of control. Since that year I have gotten so much better by myself since my mother had been cooperating with me, giving me time to get better before she has her fianc over. I do not wear gloves inside my house anymore. I can eat. I can shower. I do not self harm. I have been socializing online a lot. However last night when she said she was going to start having him over I have fallen into some of the same habits. have not really been eating. Been super depressed. Been crying and shaking all day. I am scared it will be as bad as last year - probably way worse if he comes over. Hell contaminate everything just by being in here. I am so scared. I will not be able to leave my closed room. Ill be too afraid to eat or drink anything in fear of it being contaminated. I am so so scared. cannot stop shaking. Threw up after I tried to eat something. Last year I nearly died, I do not know what worse entitles. I am scared. I made so much progress. I do not want it all to be shattered. It will all be for nothing if she has him over. She will not let me get psychological help first either before she has him over. She says she cannot afford it and she is waited long enough. Shaking while typing this. Feel really sick. Stopped talking to my friends. Stopped doing anything except sitting in my room crying. She keeps threatening me that she will call the police again if I do not start eating. She says they will arrest me this time. But I feel so sick. I am so scared. No one can afford help for me. I cannot do anything. I am stuck. What do I do? I have psychological issues with men yet my mom is going to bring a man in the house. I am so scared. She does not care. I have tried reaching out to him personally and our family. No one cares. They all think I am being irrational. And that my mom deserves happiness too. They do not understand. No one does. And I am trapped. All I am is a roadblock. No one wants me. No one can take me. I am trapped in this home. It used to be the only place I feel safe, now its the scariest place. All I do is sleep because its the only time I am at peace. I cry every time I wake up because I realize I have to face this hell. I am trapped. I am scared. I have nowhere to go. What can I even do? I cannot drive to get out of here. I cannot do anything. cannot get a job to afford professional psychological help for myself. I am stuck. And its so so so scary. What can I even do? Throwaway - I need help, advice, anything. I am stuck.',\n",

       " \"I am 23(m) and I have been dealing with depression since I was 14 (that was when I was diagnosed) and anxiety since I was 3 (separation anxiety from 3-8, social anxiety since)TLDR: Read the last large paragraph, I do not know how I can condense it more than thatWhen I was 3 my parents broke up, I was always close to my mum and to my dad I was more of an object to be owned than his son, but because he believed he deserved to have me he fought my mum for me. I know he did not care because I anytime I was with him I was put aside and never really interacted with and when I did not want to go with him he would pry my off a lamppost while I was crying and drag me to the car to take me to his house. All of this is what brought the first sembalances of my anxiety and low self esteem because if my own blood does not really love me then I took it as there was something wrong with me. And to top it off he cheated on my mum which is why they broke up and he did it before and after they were together with other women.After that my mum remarried and her next partner was fine at first but he changed when they had my younger brother. After that I was treated as a hindrance and due to the troubles of on going custody and court stuff my dad was causing during there relationship, my mum's partner saw me as my father's son and took out his frustrations on me in the first of gas lighting and mental abuse. This went on from when I was 5 till 17. He also mentally abused my mum and older sister but my little brother had an illness and my mum felt she had to stay for him. Only when he was older did she leave him and thus I was freed from his abuse.I also had an accident when I was 14 and fractured my hip, I could not walk on it at all for a year and could use partial weight only a year after that. That was the final straw for me and made me deeply depressed because the one place I could get away to was school and after not being there for months I felt alienated and alone. I am the end I just retreated to my room as that was the only place I had some semblance of safety left.All this is what has led to my deep rooted self hatred, low self worth, anxiety and depression. Since all of that all I have managed to do is idly spend my time retreating into games and barely really living. To top it all off the last 2 friends I had completely distanced themselves from me because of a difference of views and now I have no one but my mum and my siblings. Even my grandparents who always were there for me have dementia and cannot even remember me when they see me.I just feel so alone and that everyone will leave me one day And when they do there will be no reason left for me to live, even now I feel that it would be better if I just died now and saved the trouble of my family having to support me while I leech off their kindness. I do not want to be a burden but I feel so useless and I know how lazy I am and hate myself for it. I just do not know if there is a way out of the mess in my head and to live a life worth living.I am sorry if this has been extremely long and too much, I just wanted to say something somewhere to relieve the feeling built up inside 23(m) Just need to get how I feel off my chest as I have no one I can talk to\",\n",

       " \"Struggling with fear of breast cancer after seeing multiple doctors. Feeling lost. Hello everyone! This sub has been a great source of comfort for me for quite some time now. I have never felt the need to post until today as the last month has been very hard on me and I'm hoping someone will have some ideas on how I can combat my extreme health anxiety.\\n\\nAs a preface, I’m a 24 year old woman.\\n\\nAbout a month ago, I felt a giant white welt under my left breast. The next day, it was no longer raised completely, but there was a slight bump like a pimple or a bug bite, but there was no 'peak'. It was red in the area, about the size of a quarter. No pain, no itching. I don't think I would have noticed it if I hadn't felt it. I have always struggled with health anxiety but for the past 6 months it has been pretty dormant. Then I googled 'bug bite on breast' and everything spiraled from there.\\n\\nI stumbled upon Inflammatory Breast Cancer and am now convinced that I have it. I read multiple stories about how it is commonly misdiagnosed as a bug-bite (my doctor said it was a bug bite when I went in). This made my anxiety worse. So I saw another doctor at the family practice I go to. She wasn't sure what it was, it could be a pimple/skin irritation, and told me if it was still there in 2 weeks she would send me to a breast specialist.\\n\\nI made an appointment with a breast specialist on my own because I could not bear the wait. He looked at it and told me it is most likely just a skin irritation from my bra or a clogged pore that is taking a while to heal. Said if it didn't go away in another 2-3 weeks that he would send me for an ultrasound but he really didn’t think it was anything to worry about.\\n\\nAgain, this was not enough for me. I made an appointment with my OBGYN and he looked at it and echoed the same sentiment the other doctors did. It is nothing, whatever it was is on its way to healing. But he would send me for an ultrasound to set my mind at ease.\\n\\nI got the ultrasound yesterday and they didn’t find anything. They said there is a chance it was a tiny cyst that is now almost gone that it is undetectable on the machine. This should have made me feel better but I read online that IBC is very hard to detect on ultrasounds. If it didn’t go away in two weeks, the radiologist told me I should see a dermatologist because it seems to be more of a skin issue. \\n\\nThat day, I called to make an appointment with a derm because I know it takes time to get in to see them. Funnily enough, they had a cancellation that day and asked if I wanted to come in that afternoon. Of course, I said yes. \\n\\nWhen I was there, I explained my issues. The derm looked at it and again, said the same thing everyone else did. It’s most likely just a skin irritation and she gave me the option of waiting to see if it goes away on its own within 2-3 months or she could do a shave biopsy. I, of course, opted for the biopsy.\\n\\nThen I got home and did more research and found out IBC is usually only diagnosed through a punch biopsy. The biopsy I got at the derm will not be deep enough to diagnose that even if it is there.\\n\\nI cannot catch my breath and am struggling to function like a normal human being. It’s much more likely that the spot under my breast is just what everyone says it is; an irritation!!! IBC is SO rare, especially for someone my age, but it’s the deadliness of the disease that is haunting my every move. I am so terrified of death and of dying young and leaving behind everyone I love.\\n\\nI am on 10mg Buspar and have been for only a month now. The side effects are crippling me. I am only sleeping 3-4 hours a night, I’m having horrible nightmares, dizziness, headaches. I am not eating and have lost 15 pounds this month because of it. I cry hysterically almost every night. I obsessively check my boobs, whether that is starting at them in the mirror or prodding them or comparing them (the left one is bigger than the right, always has been – but my health anxiety makes me wonder if it really has always been this way).\\n\\nEvery new spot I discover or mark or freckle sends me into extreme panic. I’m struggling to meet deadlines at work. I’m letting my house go to shit. \\n\\n\\n I just started therapy last week so I am hoping that eventually starts to kick in and help as well.\\n\\nI guess what I’m looking for is advice on how to calm my nerves. How to function like a normal human being. I’m so depressed. I’m missing out on so much. \\n\\nAny words of advice would be so appreciated.\\n\",\n",

Twice already my comerades had to do sit ups because of me, but I also do not want to leave, for I do not know another way of earning money right now.My depression makes me panic in fear of fking up, everytime I have to do a task. This makes it impossible for me to do even the easiest tasks. All this pressiure and this feeling of dissapionting my squad, makes me cry myself into sleep nearly every night.

They wanted to move to another country to study and and I chose to go with them as I could not handle the relationship to end. I studied hard for an exam to be able to get in and gave a lot of effort, just for them to tell me that they will be depressed there too, and do not know why the changed countries in the first place and so on. It is something they really wanted and now that they got it they are not satisfied .I know what it is like to be depressed, so I am not saying everything should be fixed, but nothing is appreciated and everything is being complained about, and I try so hard.

I live with my gf and I do not have any story or anything special to comment onI work as a retail employee for minimum wage, I have an average B- in my classes. I have no friends, except for my gf, and my family never calls or says hello. I am an absolute nobody with not a goddamn idea where my life is going.I have had depression for a long time. When I was 15 I tried to speak up about it; and about the suicidal thoughts too. All that really did was get me medicated, and forewarned that if I tried anything Id be locked up in a mental institute for life. I stopped trying to reach out after that. Ever since, I have been trying to convince myself not bite the bullet and take my own life. The meds just make me feel hollow, and any attempt I make trying to improve my mental state just eases my mind temporarily. I do not want sympathy, I am fact, I do not know what I want. I feel like I am just floating through life, but every second I reflect upon who I am I just hate myself. I am a shitty bf, a terrible son, a nobody who means nothing in the world but another average face in the crowd.

Basically, I am a 26 year old male and I am feeling bogged down by life and quite miserable. To give some background, I still live at home with parents, I have a fairly decent job, a girlfriend and a small group of close friends however over the past few years I have been struggling to feel content with life. I live in the uk and from a young age I have always craved adventure and living a exciting life. During my late teens and early 20s I have lived abroad, travelled the south east, been on multiple holidays but there is something I cannot quite put my finger on as to why I feel unhappy with life at the moment.Over the past few years transitioning from being a happy go lucky university student to then entering the real world has been a real struggle for me. The area I live has very little work opportunities and is known to be a less desirable part of the UK to live in. I feel that everyone does the same predictable routine of, working a job they hate Monday - Friday and then drink heavily on a weekend to numb the pain and then repeat (myself included). I really feel I am growing out of the uks drinking culture and want to completely change my lifestyle.I just feel that there has to be more to life than this. The majority of people I know are looking to get their first house/ engagement and to settle down but the thought of settling for this existence really scares me. I feel guilty for feeling this way, like I should be grateful that I have been dealt a fairly comfortable life. A week holiday once a year, an ok wage, food in the fridge and a caring family but I cannot help feeling that there has got to be more to life than this. I crave community, travel, adventure, good relationships, passion, excitement. But at the moment I feel dull and like the energy has been sucked out of me through joining the 9-5 rat race and falling into the trap that everyone does.I suppose the reason for writing this was to understand whether it is normal to feel like this?Is this just what growing up is all about? If anyone had any tips on how to change this mindset of these circumstances?Is it unrealistic to think life can be exciting all of the time?Thanks for reading and I would be grateful if anyone had any tips or pointers or even just to find if anyone is in the same boat!

       " 'Health anxiety makes everyday tasks so difficult Some background about my health anxiety history - I’ve had severe health anxiety intermittently since my teens.  Most often I am preoccupied with my heart.  My heart rate has always jumped up quickly (~180ish bpm) with minimal exercise or even at times of rest, but my resting heart rate is usually 45-55 bpm.  I mention numbers just because my heart rate is a little atypical-but I have been checked out by cardiologists so many times over the past 15 years, always with the reassurance that I am fine. Most recently, this past summer I wore a 30 day holter monitor where they would measure my episodes of high heart rate. They also did a stress test, numerous ekgs, etc. They confirmed I had periods of sinus tachycardia, but it was normal rhythm and said I was healthy.  They said the heart was appropriately responding and was likely beating fast because of anxiety (which I don’t think is the whole story, I think I have a food allergy which can trigger it, but that’s beside the point.). They gave me a low dose of beta blockers to take as needed for comfort/anxiety, but promised I wouldn’t have a heart attack, with or without the pills.  \\n\\nAnyways, to bring my story to today, I’ve been putting off doing laundry for far too long.  Im embarrassed to admit I have been buying new clothes to prolong my laundry chore. The issue is in my apartment I have to carry my laundry down a few flights of stairs, outside and into another building. After it’s clean I have to carry it again outside and then up a few flights of stairs. The laundry basket is heavy and my heart races so fast when I do this, and I panic. \\n\\nI just did a load and I could feel my heart beating out of my chest. I sat down with a glass of water and within 60 seconds my heart rate was back in the 70s. I remind myself that my stress test was normal, even when they brought my heart rate to 190 for several minutes. But I am still so freaked out. I have several more loads to do and I’m so afraid.\\n\\nI know part of the answer is that I am incredibly out of shape and weak. This is not coincidence -I am extremely avoidant of anything that raises my heart rate , and am terrified of exercising.  I stopped wearing my Fitbit a few months ago (at the urging of my therapist) because I obsessively measured my heart rate and was even afraid of standing up/walking - I believed if my heart rate went above 80 it would trigger a heart attack.  Taking off my Fitbit was one of the scariest things I’ve done but now that it’s been a few months I feel SO much better.  I do my best not to measure heart rate now and have been going on more walks, but lifting anything makes me feel my heart rate and I can’t ignore it.   I just feel so stuck and like I can’t keep up with basic chores.  I feel like a failure of an adult. \\n\\nI don’t know what I’m asking for, this is mostly a rant. I’ve been lurking this subreddit for months and it’s brought me a lot of comfort.  Health anxiety is such a difficult illness but this community helps me feel less alone.\\n\\nTLDR: my health anxiety is about my heart rate/heart attacks. Basic chores like laundry elevate my heart rate and cause panic and avoidance. Feel like I can’t keep up with life. ',\n",

Especially because for some stupid reason I\\'ve placed all my eggs in one basket and insisted on becoming a successful author no matter how stupid or hard or impossible it is to do that these days. I haven\\'t even tried to date anyone in over 10 years so though I\\'d like a relationship, I\\'m socially inept and awkward. I also have a lot of baggage not just from an abusive father but from two abusive relationships I was stupid enough to get into. At my age with my history, no one wants to even attempt to deal with that nonsense and as I said I\\'m inept at socializing because of my own problems. I don\\'t have a \"career\" like my siblings. I don\\'t have a family. I don\\'t even have a job because of a permanent disability making it almost impossible for me to work. Though I have written several novels, they more than likely will never see anything resembling profit or commercial success. Most of my days are spent playing video games, hating my life, and writing because I\\'m too stubborn to give up on that dream despite every single sign telling me that I\\'m old, it\\'s over, and there\\'s no way I\\'m talented enough to make it work. \\n\\nI know that people will say that I shouldn\\'t measure my success by other people or people around me but let me tell you. It\\'s exceedingly hard to show up to family functions when all your siblings are married professionals with their own houses and you are the loser who has been single for 15 years because she can\\'t manage to get into a relationship that\\'s not abusive and would prefer to stay at home, alone with her cat who\\'s gonna die soon anyway because he\\'s old. If you want to suggest therapy or medication...I\\'ve done both. Medication isn\\'t a fix for me and I\\'ve tried it on and off for years. Therapy has been a constant in my life since I was 18 so if you can possibly imagine it I was far worse than \\\\*this\\\\* before now. If anything I could \\\\*possibly\\\\* say it\\'s a miracle that I\\'ve come as far as I have with recovering from abuse, dealing with addiction, an eating disorder, and my anxiety issues. Yet, at the same time, I desire things that I\\'m 99% sure I can never have and I know I\\'m running out of time. Is there any way to cope with the fact that my life just isn\\'t going to get fixed and I\\'m pretty much doomed to waiting the clock out for the next 30-40 years if I\\'m somehow lucky enough not to get cancer or some other terrible disease?',\n",

       " 'TLDR; bf is getting more depressed over time. I am trying so hard to get him the help he needs. I am getting pushed away and its affecting my mental health now. I feel like everything is pointing towards us breaking up.we have been dating for about 1.5 years. I have GAD and moderate/mild depression. I am currently on medications and in therapy. He has severe depression (and anxiety I suspect), and has been in therapy before. Hes going back to therapy, but there were not any availabilities until August. He has a history of getting depressed in relationships (previous two gfs and me).He and I have similar histories. Both our families had pretty nasty divorces. Both of our mothers developed cancer while we were still young teenagers. Our families are in similar geographic regions. We both had a relationship that was emotionally abusive. I guess I mention these because it was easy for us to understand each other when we first met, but also because I think these could have impacted our mental developments and relationships.Both my partner and I are in graduate school. He has a major exam coming up that determines if he will qualify for candidacy. This exam has been looming for a while and has been pushed back a couple of times because of COVID, but also because he was not prioritizing preparing for it. This stressor is contributing to his depression.The other stressor is our relationship. Its been on the rocks for a couple of months now. He left to visit family in May and he was not in the mood to have sex when he came back. I miss the sexual intimacy, but I am much prefer physical affection and emotional intimacy. Having said that, its always been hard for him to open up to me. In June, he did something that really upset me at the time, which started his spiraling. I have since forgiven him, but I do not think hes forgiven himself. He admitted hes been depressed for a while now. I did not see the signs very well and attributed it to stress from his exam (before I knew our relationship was also stressing him out). He said a lot of self-hate things and started punching himself in the face. I called his dad and told him what is going on because I felt like I could not be his only support. we have been in limbo (how he described it) since June. We did not see each other much the first couple of weeks because we both needed space. After that, I have been the one initiating contact and hanging out to get a feel for things. we have been telling we love and miss each other still. However, he told me this weekend that the physical affection is hurting him and he was not comfortable with me going to our mutual friends because he cannot be a boyfriend right now. For 4th of July, he also did not act like my boyfriend.This really hurt me but I have been trying to listen to his needs more because of his depression. Hes asked for more space to focus on school, which also hurts but I do the same when I need to get work done. I have tried to get him into our schools counseling between now and his regular therapist, but he does not want to talk to a new therapist. I have also tried to get him to couples therapy. He said he would go, but its obvious he does not want to be there, so I have not scheduled anything because I do not think it would be productive if he does not want to be there. I have asked if I can help him around his house because he is not taking care of himself. I have asked how can I support him, which was the space mentioned above.He does not know what he wants in regards to us. I do not know if its the depression talking. Hes scared if we have an on and off relationship that I will eventually leave him for good because an ex did that. Hes thinks I am disappointed in him (I have never said this, he sets these expectations for himself) because he cannot be a boyfriend right now. I feel he does love me because 1) friends and his family have told me he loves and cares about me very much, 2) he showed it through his actions before all of this, 3) he told me he loves making me happy. But, my doubts have been creeping in. He said his depression is getting worse. He does not want to see me, I feel like I am walking on eggshells because I cannot tell him how this is affecting me without him spiraling, and I just feel like I keep hurting him when I am trying my best to help him. I cannot help but think his feelings for me have changed.I love him so much for so many reasons. I loved him early on in our relationship but I wanted to be sure it was real and not infatuation, so I did not say anything until maybe 9 months in. I wish he could see what I see. But him pushing me away is hurting me and affecting my mental health now. My anxiety is through the roof and I can feel my depression starting.I am not exactly sure what I am looking for from you guys, but thanks for reading if you made it to the end. My boyfriend is pushing me away and I am at a loss',\n",
       " 'How do you even begin to explain your depression? I am hurting and I feel super alone. I have people around me and I am sure they will listen, but to what extent? I have ended up here because I feel like I am imploding and just want someone to hear me and know what I feel. I am a wife and a mother of one. My marriage is happy and my son is amazing, but I cannot get away from my depression and anxiety. I have had a bounty of traumatic experiences growing up, but who has not? I truly try to live for each day and leave the past where it belongs. I am extremely self-aware. I understand my mental illness. I am a very analytical person. I think that because of this, it makes my mental health worse. I want to fix myself, but I do not know how. I have extreme fears of being alone. I am terrified my husband will eventually decide to leave me because I am such a disaster (though he has shown no intention of this at all). Who wants to be married to a crazy person, right? I have never been in a relationship that was not emotionally abusive until I married my husband. Both of my parents were drug addicts and I was raised by my grandparents (who are incredible by the way). My biological mother (who was physically and emotionally abusive) is still a piece of work (putting it nicely). It took years, but my dad recovered and I do love him very much even though he still has some issues I am still uncomfortable with. In spite of that I have become a successful person. I swore Id never ever let my children see a moment of what I did as a child, and I have not, but I am still here feeling like a failure. I feel worthless. My insecurity is disgusting and my fears are eating me alive. I guess it does not help that I have barely any friends and now that I am working from home I am basically left to my own torment, every day. I used to have loads of friends when I lived in another city, but once I became pregnant I decided I needed to be closer to family. I did not move back home, just near. So I moved to a small town where I know no one. After starting my job once I moved. I have begun to have friends again, but none of them I feel close enough to be able to really open up. Honestly they are probably very open to listening, but I am still here terrified of judgment and causing what little friends I do have to go running for the hills. Because who wants to be friends with someone so mentally unstable?I am tired of crying and I want my brain to stop. I just want to fix my mental state. I can fix everything else. I can give the best advice and I have picked so many people up from very low points in their lives, but I cannot fix me. I am so sorry this is so long. Honestly I could write a novel because there are so many sub-categories to what is adding to my mental health crisis, but where do you even start when you have never been heard?I am so tired.
