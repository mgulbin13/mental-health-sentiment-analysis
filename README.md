# Mental Health Sentiment Analysis using Machine Learning
By Matthew Gulbin

## Overview
For this project, I decided to research social media sentiment analysis, particularly through the lens of mental health. To that end, I trained machine learning models to try to predict mental health conditions (anxiety, depression, etc.) based on text input from a user. 

This project is made up primarily by two files: a Jupyter notebook, where I performed the data cleaning, modeling, and tuning, and a Python file for a web app that I built using Streamlit that allows the user to enter text and receive a prediction from the model.

## Initial Model

I implemented the initial model using Multinominal Naive Bayes. It performed horribly, with a F1 score of 0.17, due to semantic overlap between categories such as anxiety and stress.
